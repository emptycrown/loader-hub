22 February 2014,A big surprise,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,9
25 July 2018,Nice movie about psychopathic facebook founder,Fast paced and interesting this movie tries too hard to portray Zuckenberg in a better light than he deserves He was not a good coder He was much more exploitative than movie suggest as his later love affair with CIA and selling personal data of facebook users for nefarious purposes proved This guy is far less charismatic than portrayed and he isn t portrayed as particularly charismatic to begin with and far more calculating menacing and Machiavelian than described The only thing the movie did show worse than it was was Zuckenberg incel situation Zuckenberg was dating a Chinese golddigger smartdigger Harvarddigger the whole time and they got married But despite being more positive towards its subject than they would warrant the movie manages to capture part of the psychopathic nature of facebook and its founding Artistic liberties were taken in order to humanize these monsters to make us care and for plot not to be boring In that it succeeded but humanizing monsters like Zuckenberg or Hitttlerr is never a good idea in a movie However you at least get an idea about the depths of the cutthrooat depravity that was only confirmed by the fact that facebook abuses the trust of its sheeple all the time and a movie is fun to watch and deserves a praise even if it is an idealised sanitized overseksed version of the sorry reality this movie is based on and as a movie is well worth a watch but keep in mind the reality was much darker and more boring at the same time,9
18 January 2011,"Amazingly directed, Greatly Scripted, and Impeccably acted. What more can you ask for in a movie?",I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,9
2 April 2011,A modern classic,I heard a lot of promising things about The Social Network And you know what I agree with the positivity this film has received for it is my idea of a modern classic With an intriguing concept it is for me one of the defining films I have seen recently one of the best movies of 2010 and relevant in its themes of greed betrayal class tension friendship and loyalty and concept Production values wise The Social Network looks wonderful The cinematography is incredibly skillful and the editing is crisp In fact I d sure The Social Network is director David Fincher s most stylish film since Se7en I have heard a lot of mixed feelings on the score while it is not my favourite of the year not like Toy Story 3 King s Speech and Inception The Social Network s brooding smooth and quite sexy score is very memorable and fits well with the film s occasionally quirky tone The Social Network is very well directed too Fincher directs with an intensity and focus that makes The Social Network tied with Se7en as the best of his movies in my opinion Another strong point is the screenplay which is very smart and sharp while the story making the most of this intriguing concept is constantly snappy and engaging Also all the characters are very well written and assembled for me they are among the best written characters in a Fincher movie It also helps that the acting is as impeccable as it is Jesse Eisenberg is very commanding as the titular character in a subtle sort of way while Andrew Garfield also impresses as the voice of reason character I was surprised in a good way by Justin Timberlake while the weakest of the three leads he does have a cocksure swagger here that he actually pulls off really well In conclusion a wonderful film and one of the best of the year 10 10 Bethany Cox,10
20 July 2020,Excellent,As Quentin Tarantino said this is one of the best movies of the 21st Century I believe that for the sole reason of the foundinh story and the captivating storytelling of the pioneers that forged a completely new age for the new generation,8
20 October 2010,It really shouldn't work,This is a film which simply shouldn t work but it does magnificently A story centred on a teenager who becomes the world s youngest billionaire a web site that reaches a million users in two years and a cast of real life characters with names like Zuckerberg and Winklevoss just shouldn t be possible A convoluted tale of raw conflict on the origins of a new type of web site should not lend itself to an expensive movie as opposed to a television documentary It succeeds because it is not about the technology but about creativity and conflict and about friendship and betrayal It succeeds because of a magical combination of accomplished direction scintillating dialogue and superb acting The direction comes from David Fincher who has had variable success all the way from Alien 3 to Se7en but here he is right on form with a flashy but tightly structured presentation that never fails to command your attention and interest The all important sparkling script is courtesy of Aaron Sorkin who gave us The West Wing the best television series ever and yet apparently does not do social networking At the heart of the movie is a brilliant Oscar worthy performance from Jesse Eisenberg as the 19 year old Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg the genius behind The Facebook the social network the unsympathetic anti hero of the adventure a borderline sociopath variously described by women characters as an asshole and someone just trying so hard to be one Andrew Garfield is excellent as Zuckerberg s Harvard roommate and co founder of the site Eduardo Savarin thanks to the wonders of CGI Arnie Hammer manages to be terrific as both the twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss while singer Justin Timberlake is a revelation as the Napster founder Sean Parker This is a testosterone charged fable with room for women only in minor support roles ironic in that getting girls was the impetus for the Facebook project The film opens in 2003 with a breathlessly wordy encounter and closes in 2009 with a poignantly wordless scene In between the story zips along at the frenetic pace characterised by the business itself Adapted from Ben Mezrich s book The Accidental Millionaires the framework for the fascinating narrative is not one but two courtroom dramas or to be more accurate pre trial hearings both resulted in out of court settlements which tells you a lot Clearly you shouldn t judge a book by its cover,

20 January 2014,The Power Of Great Direction,So there I was sitting in the cinema waiting to see Inception greeting every belated trailer with a groan each one prolonging the time till I could finally see one of the most anticipated movies of the year and there it was I turned to one of my friends my god a film about facebook To say I was skeptical for those few moments would be an understatement I was almost angry like a footballer who releases an autobiography 5 years after he starts his career I just didn t understand the timing of it who cares anyway I think this is Finchers new movie actually DAVID Fincher He s made a film about facebook Almost immediately Social Network became a movie that I needed to see David Fincher is one of the true masters of delivering some of the greatest films of the past few decades The gritty Se7en and the intelligent Fight Club had been two of my favourite movies growing up the latter of which I had the privilege of studying in college quite in depth and although I missed Benjamin Button only god knows why it took me until 2013 to watch I had thoroughly enjoyed the enigmatic Zodiac as well Social Network became my favourite Fincher title almost immediately It is one of those rare works that feels so effortless in its brilliance which is due to the incredible work from both Fincher and Sorkin in creating this modern masterpiece the way I see it the film relies heavily upon three aspects which are executed with perfection First of all the score for this film is sensational I ve always been a huge fan of Trent Reznor Nine Inch Nails but with his partnership with Atticus Ross and his ongoing collaborations with Fincher also see Girl With The Dragon Tattoo I can only see them becoming the most formidable artists in the industry every minor note resonates perfectly throughout the film and creates a beautiful texture on top of an already excellent piece of work Secondly Sorkin s razor sharp screenplay is something a director can only dream of receiving the dialogue never falters and it is always witty sincere and hilarious all in one which can also be attributed to the performances of the actors involved But most of all the atmosphere that Fincher is able to create visually is stunning huge credit must also go to long time collaborator Jeff Cronenweth together their formidable partnership and undoubted perfect understanding of each other s work is clearly the factor behind this film being one of the best movies of the past decade Great performances from Eisenberg Garfield and Timberlake also help this movie stand head and shoulders above most and as one of the most promising young actresses in the business Rooney Mara is given her first chance to truly show her quality in a small role It s difficult to say where Social Network will stand when we look back on Finchers body of work but one things for sure if it isn t seen as one of his truly great masterpieces then he is sure to become one of if not the most powerful director in the industry for years to come,9
28 September 2010,"A timeless story of friendship, loyalty, greed and betrayal",I just want to get this out there right away and put the cards on the table so to speak When I first heard about it I had very little faith in this project I was stupefied confused by the thought of what attracted all this talent to this seemingly trivial story to begin with Why would David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin possibly be interested in the story of the founding of Facebook Surely they could have found something more important more meaningful to apply their efforts to After seeing the film though I realized that of course Fincher and Sorkin knew what they were doing all along And furthermore that labeling this as The Facebook movie is really an insult to what Sorkin and Fincher were trying to and have succeeded in achieving with this film First and foremost I have to take a step back and admire this film as a technical achievement Despite seeming to be a departure for Fincher in terms of content and subject matter which it is and then again isn t the film is very clearly and undeniably a Fincher film Re teaming with his Fight Club director of photography Jeff Cronenweth Fincher manages to create and capture that really unique look all of his films have The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous once again Fincher proves that he is probably getting the best results in digital photography out of any other director working in that medium and this film shot on the RED One camera looks absolutely beautiful from the framing to the camera movement to the lighting and on to the look and the feel of the depth of field the RED captures Sorkin s script is also an impeccable achievement and showcases once again just what a genius this man really is From a structural standpoint it employs a very effective use of a framing device the Zuckerberg lawsuit depositions which introduce the various characters and lead into flashbacks of the events being discussed It really lends the film a Rashomon air and intensifies the mystery behind the Zuckerberg character and what exactly transpired in the creation of this phenomenon Facebook Sorkin also demonstrates an acute awareness of character construction and manages to create a loathsome protagonist we hate and are frustrated by but yet we still end up sympathizing with Most of all though it s a showcase of Sorkin s impeccable writing style and knack for writing dialogue with a very unique sound and rhythm I saw Fincher refer to it as Sorkinese in an interview and this is a really good description it is certainly very unique to Sorkin and the scripts he has written and it is also certainly a completely unique language one which normal people in our real world do not speak but that just sounds great on screen The rapid fire overlapping dialogue remains one of the highlights of the film for me and the script is certainly a shoo in for Oscar consideration The film is also a rare showcase of pure acting prowess and features a very interesting and eclectic cast of young actors stepping out of their comfort zones and delivering some truly phenomenal work The casting of the film is quite a departure for Fincher who has enough clout to gather the biggest names working in the business Instead he opted to go for a cast of relative unknowns or up and comers and really make stars out of them First and foremost to be mentioned is Jesse Eisenberg an actor I have personally been a fan of since The Squid and the Whale in 2005 and one whose work I have continued to enjoy since then However no matter how good he was in those previous films none of his previous performances compare to his amazing achievement on this film Stripping away his signature goofiness and neurosis Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg as a cold calculated and determined genius who knows what he wants is very confident and forward looking and will stop at nothing to get it His counter in the film is Saverin played brilliantly by Andrew Garfield a name we will be hearing a lot more of of in the next few years Saverin is a far more sympathetic character more warm and inviting these traits only increase the impact of the tragedy of Zuckerberg s betrayal of their friendship Many pundits and commentators have designated this to be the film that defines our generation and truly a product of its time in the most literal sense of the word However I m not sure I like this designation especially since once you watch the film you very quickly realize that this isn t a story about the founding of Facebook it s really a story of friendship ambition and betrayal a character study of this fascinating individual whose actions in the film happen to depict the invention of an online social networking site that gets out of hand and puts all of his relationships especially that with his best friend and business partner in jeopardy All of the themes mentioned above are universal and can be applied to a number of fantastic films and works of fiction over the centuries and that I think is the greatest achievement of the film,10
16 July 2011,"I'm thinking of deleting my facebook account, don't know if that's what the movie was aiming for",I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,7
22 May 2012,Zuckerberg the Great?,I had to go into this with a grain of salt The Facebook phenomenon is quite amazing and has made changes to our society that we will be dealing with for decades That said I don t put Zuckerberg in the same room with Thomas Edison The fact is that if Facebook had never been created the world would have gone on just fine Perhaps it would be a better more humane world One where people don t spend their lives producing tons of personal garbage that is really of no interest The word friend has taken on a whole new meaning It sounds then that because of personal bias I wouldn t like the movie I did It s intriguing to watch this twerp hit all the right notes and put into action the phenomenon that has taken place I really felt like I was in the room with these guys that I participated in their discoveries and plans Jesse Eisenberg is so believable that whenever I see Zuckerberg on television I think Wow he looks a lot like Jesse Eisenberg I can t buy the criticism that this movie is exploitative If this story was going to be told it had to be told now because the events are as fleeting as that computer you bought last week It helped me to understand what went on I recently saw Mark Zuckerberg bemoaning the failures of our schools I think that he and his ilk are as much responsible as any poor teacher or principal The numbing of America or world isn t helping much But this film allows us to have a view of it s potential undoing,9

2 October 2010,You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies.,On a fall night in 2003 Harvard undergrad and computer programming genius Mark Zuckerberg sits down at his computer and heatedly begins working on a new idea In a fury of blogging and programming what begins in his dorm room soon becomes a global social network and a revolution in communication A mere six years and 500 million friends later Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history but for this entrepreneur success leads to both personal and legal complications Sony Pictures THE SOCIAL NETWORK is not about Facebook It s about Mark Zuckerberg and the people associated with him and the consequences that arise with the evolution of Facebook In an even broader sense it s about friends being driven apart due to money and betrayal Because of this it s no surprise that many have already compared this to CITIZEN KANE And it s not just the similarities in themes that are astounding it s the quality as well What makes THE SOCIAL NETWORK so good is the masterfully written script by Aaron Sorkin The film is filled with impeccable dialog that just sucks you in It would be no surprise if the film won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay Director David Fincher also does a great job keeping the audience captivated through and through with a consistently fast pace Really you ll probably be drawn to the film s opening argument between two characters than any other scene this year All right I m exaggerating but you get the point It s not Fincher s best work but it s in the top 3 Jesse Eisenberg and co star Andrew Garfield are the driving force behind this film Eisenberg does a terrific job delivering the lines as he did while Garfield brings in an emotional aspect to the film Although both are quite excellent Garfield s performance is Oscar worthy Rooney Mara is quickly getting up the ladder after having last seen her in the remake of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET in the beginning of the year She s just in a few scenes but she s great in them I would have like to see her more in the film though Apparently Armie Hammer played two characters as twins in the film which really blew me away when I found out because I thought they were two different actors He really distinguished the characters really well Oh and if you re worried about Justin Timberlake don t be He s really good in here I also loved Rashida Jones in the few scenes she was in With terrific performances from the cast all around a brilliant script some fine directing by Fincher and an engaging score by Trent Reznor it should be no surprise that THE SOCIAL NETWORK succeeded the way it did Although it s a 2 hour dialog driven film it absolutely engrossing to watch If anything this is probably the closest modern version of CITIZEN KANE that we will ever get in a long time THE SOCIAL NETWORK is easily one of the best films of the year,10
9 October 2010,Revolutionary for our time,When I first heard that David Fincher was making a film about the networking site Facebook I was definitely very skeptical Well there was no need to be Fincher took Aaron Sorkin s brilliantly clever screenplay and turned it into a film that highlights the best and worst moments of out technology based life The Social Network s first scene is brilliantly written and acted and it sets the mood that both Fincher and Sorkin want to set for the rest of the film The film is seen as the advancement of how Mark Zuckerberg got his world famous website started Now I know that a lot of the film was exaggerated or fictional but it does not matter Sorkin and Fincher have brought us this really interesting character who is brilliantly played by Jesse Eisenberg Eisenberg is one of the best young actors in this time and while he has mostly done comedy until now his role demands much more attention to subtlety and character nuances to move along Last year Eisenberg showed us that he could create some of the most likable characters in films like Zombieland and Adventureland and this year he proves to us that he can actually create a very flawed and condescending but still sympathetic character that we may or may not end up hating This was credit to his real talent Andrew Garfield was also pretty much equal in terms of performance and he was a true star next to Eisenberg s character The rest of the cast are all fine including Justin Timberlake that has proved over the years that he can actually act pretty impressively On another note the film might seem very different than Fincher s other films which include pretty much all crime thrillers and a fantasy Benjamin Button but I thought that he was able to leave his mark on the film It certainly took itself seriously which for a film like this is fortunate The cinematography was also very impressive but not showy and very keen on the real focus of the film Ultimately The Social Network is a very hard film to dislike However I also know that it is not the type of easy going fun but forgettable film that many including me expected months ago It is more profound more meaningful but it might not hit a nerve with all viewers including the young that will only want to see the Facebook Movie I think The Social Network has a lot of similarity to last year s Up In The Air Both represent a dilemma about people s communications in the modern world and both can be seen as perfect examples of what life in the 21st century was like The Social Network is about the many connections that we have with others and it makes you feel the longing and loneliness that might come with it It is David Fincher s best to date,
28 July 2020,I'll tell you why this is so re-watchable,Flash Review Editing and Dialog The intelligently written script is machine gunned out at as brisk a rate as the film s pacing echoes the mind of Zuckerberg and the hockey stick growth of Facebook The chronology flows together with perfection and is complimented by Fincher s slick and glossy atmosphere The story is spliced between the startup phase of Facebook and the legal battle between the twins and his co founder Not sure how accurate the portrayal of the characters are but it makes for an entertaining story which could have easily been boring Yet another great Fincher film,9
26 February 2011,Geniality and Arrogance Associated to an Absolute Lack of Ethics and Respect,In the Harvard University in the Fall of 2003 the arrogant nerd Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg is an outcast student that shares his room in the Kirkland House with his only friend the Brazilian Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield When Mark s girlfriend Erica Albright Rooney Mara breaks with him he blogs infamies about her in his Facematch and breaches the security and hacks the files of the female students of Harvard in a competition of who would be the hottest His blog has 22 000 accesses and Mark is loathed by the students and gets six months of academic probation However he calls the attention of the twin students Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss Armie Hammer and their partner Divya Narendra Max Minghella that are preparing a social network and need a programmer Mark steals their idea and invites Eduardo to be his partner in the social network Facebook Sooner Mark becomes a millionaire betrays Eduardo and faces law suits from his former friend Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and Divya Narendra The Social Network is the true story of the creation of the Facebook by Mark Zuckerberg who is described as an arrogant unethical outcast douchebag nerd His geniality and arrogance associated to an absolute lack of Ethics and respect makes him an unbearable and despicable character Fortunately I do not have Facebook My vote is seven Title Brazil A Rede Social The Social Network,7
18 January 2022,I deleted my account after watching this film,Straight up I must say that this whole narrative of Mark Zuckerberg inventing facebook just doesn t sit right with me Isn t it a Darpa invention for data mining And Zucks was the innocent face to through up front This all felt like a giant well made ad,8
5 December 2020,The social Network,Excellent movie Jesse Eisenberg mastered the character of Mark Zuckerberg and sympathized with Eduardo Saverin and the directing in the film was excellent and the filming in the film was excellent I recommend watching it,8
1 October 2010,The Social Network,Let s start with the script It s great Written by soon to be best adapted screenplay nominee winner Aaron Sorkin The Social Network s writing is intelligent and demanding on multiple levels most obviously the story is cleverly structured across dual lawsuits but there s an equal amount of sophistication to Sorkin s character work Zuckerberg is never quite capable of maintaining a dialog Eduardo always stops just short of explicating his emotions Those two characters are wonderfully played by inevitable acting award nominees Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield Eisenberg owns the brisk pace of the film while Garfield brings most of the humanity who anchor a terrific ensemble SAG best ensemble perhaps The film s score is a perfectly atmospheric concoction of electronica from edgy dark horse best original score nominees Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross and it s all united under the name and vision of David Fincher who did not win an Oscar for Fight Club or Zodiac or Benjamin Button All of this is to say two things this is a really great movie from a phenomenal creative team and also there are times when the film feels somewhat calculated for accolades never in the repugnantly safe crowd pleasing middle brow Benjamin Button sense but in the sweetly transparent sense of a kid who did all his chores and is suggesting that he might deserve a cookie You know what Give David Fincher a cookie The Social Network is thoroughly intelligent and engaging as a modern biopic and as an examination of evolving cultural currency and it s also one of my favorite films this year TK 10 1 10,

31 July 2023,Facebook has a lot to answer for.,Driven Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg becomes a billionaire by creating Facebook the film looks at its conception it s success and the subsequent controversies and lawsuits that followed This is one very well made polished movie Almost fourteen years on its still sharp polished and slick it still packs a punch The problem I have is that the central character puts me on edge It s not hard to look back to the early years of Facebook and to remember that people went absolutely crazy for it everyone I knew was on there faces from the past present people I didn t even know These days it s there for the sake of nostalgia Facebook has a lot to answer for I actually think it s put a generation backwards when it comes to actual real social interactions an inability to converse and interact in the real world we all know someone who s a keyboard warrior It s interesting as it s a big moment in history Facebook really did change the world and it is Zuckerberg who s ultimately responsible but wow every single character in this film is absolutely loathsome with the possible exception of one of them they re all horrendous and impossible to like relate to what a world we live in Jesse Eisenberg is terrific as Zuckerberg the ultimate DBE dead behind the eyes even now when I watch him interviewed trying not to hurl something at the screen I question whether he s on the same wavelength as a gone else Timberlake and Garfield are both very good in their roles Drunk angry stupid and blogging That sums it all up very well 8 10,8
4 December 2010,An Acceptable Form Of Horror,Maybe I m too old No not maybe I am I saw this characters as aliens of sorts I know they represent today s landscape brrrrr The film as a film is one of the best of David Fincher but the universe it explores gave the chills A world approaching its end fast The youth of the characters made it even more sinister I couldn t detect their soul or any evidence of its existence In a way they represent the worst of the previous generations Roman Emperors or Wall Street Profit is the name of the game and the ideas come out of boredom of longings to get laid Love and friendship loyalty and or honor as obsolete as good manners Jesse Eisenberg is chillingly perfect as the humanoid that started it all or did he Justin Timberlake keeps surprising me Good very good and Andrew Garfield the most recognizable of the characters is a victim of sorts and he ll be destroyed no matter how much money he gets How I wish this was merely a science fiction film,7
9 November 2010,Interesting rather than thrilling,I had heard plenty of positive comments about the Social Network and have finally got around to seeing it I must confess to being slightly disappointed The story follows the founders of Facebook and their rapid rise to fame It is an interesting portrayal of the pressures that come with owning a company that is worth a fortune The tagline to the film is that if you have 500 million friends then you re bound to make enemies along the way The story is really about how success leads to people wanting to share in the success and how it ultimately splits up genuine friendship Overall I found the film well acted well directed and reasonable but not really gripping,4

26 September 2012,"This history of Facebook is exciting--for a awhile. Lots of filler here & great script, great acting.",The Social Network 2010 The rise of Facebook is so sensational in terms of money and culture a movie about it was inevitable and it came early in the game Appropriately Everything is speeded up in this world and who knows why turn might make Facebook the next AOL or Nokia And so it is quite the story I don t think it s such a great movie in movie making terms however and this flies in the face of a lot of critical acclaim Beyond the main story line there are lots of party and social scenes that are meant to display the changing lifestyles of the main characters much of which is openly inaccurate These are prolonged enough to lose their point and after a few of them they lose their initial interest too They are really meant to serve as interesting ways to have dialog about the stellar rise in members and money involved with Facebook Because of course there is no action in a movie like this It s mostly dialog It s about ideas and numbers and watching computer screens We are led through the initial moments of inspiration possible intellectual theft and good luck at the beginning of Zuckerberg s rise But there are only so many aspects to this rise that can hold interest for us It is pinned together through a more recent scene in a well appointed briefing room as a couple of the leading characters give testimony about who really started Facebook Flashbacks fill up the rest of the film What to miss The long and overly filmic rowing scenes part of which were partly scale models actually What not to miss The lead deadpan performance by Jesse Eisenberg and the really moving performance that steals every scene he s in by Andrew Garfield Justin Timberlake is good too and will be a separate draw for some The twins turn out to not be twins quite incredibly a body double was the second twin and the face of the first actor was digitally inserted into the second one Crazy stuff The writing is superb Aaron Sorkin is key here making some of the dialog really virtuosic including the first scene a dialog in a bar between Zuckerberg and his would be never will be girlfriend which took 99 takes all shot with the legendary digital Red camera The filming as such is really good in a functional way and with the experienced Jeff Cronenweth in charge he did minor flicks like Fight Club and the American Girl with the Dragon Tattoo And Cronenweth is one of director s David Fincher s big reasons for success Fincher is a terrific director and you might say he made the most of a story with little real substance But I m not sure that s true I just saw Moneyball a second time last week and it holds up really well even though it generally lacks what you would call action too and was written in part by Aaron Sorkin as well I think Moneyball whatever its defects is a better movie Both movies are about contemporary society and the changing way we use computers and the way people behind the scenes have made this true Facebook is a story we are all destined to be affected by whether you learn of it through the movie or elsewhere Many people are just totally gaga about the crazy amount of money involved the movie clicks The title of the book this was based on is perfect The Accidental Billionaires So true For me though I m like Zuckerberg himself I just don t care about money and so the main draw in scene after scene was missing Judge for yourself,7
19 February 2011,"Smart, snappy and engaging thanks to good writing, performance and structure",As someone who has never joined Facebook and don t have any desire to do so I approached the film on the subject with a certain caution since although I was aware of the various back and forwards legally between all the individuals involved I had generally treated it with only slight interest because I really don t care to consider how much money those involved now have So it is to the film s credit then that I was easily held for the duration of the film and that the two hour running time zipped past Opening with a scene of rapid fire dialogue that only people in Aaron Sorkin s world talk in the film keeps up the pace throughout with lots of snappy and convincing dialogue This is also impressive when one considers that the majority of the action is either occurring in coding within computers or in stuffy conference rooms between two legal teams This is where the importance of structure comes in and the film effortlessly moves between the two lawsuits and the events themselves as they unfold None of it is in flashback per se but rather the audience is being told the story and getting to know the characters across the different time zones at the same time without any real problem in terms of losing the audience or fragmenting the telling it is a very strong structure and one that is edited together really well In the telling Zuckerberg is the focus and he doesn t come off well at all although I imagine his immense wealth will perhaps soothe him a little Here though he is very much an intellectual geeky type difficult to get to know and once he is able to be himself one discovers that actually he is even more of a jerk than when he at least had some sheer of politeness about him He is the cynical heart of the film when it comes to the rather selfish manner in which the business unfolds with Zuckerberg caught up in himself and seemingly motivated by some deeper sense of failing and inadequacy that manifests itself in a barely concealed jealously Thankfully the film balances this character with the much more sympathetic Eduardo who is really the heart of the piece in that he allows us to see Zuckerberg more clearly by virtue of outcomes and not just actions How much these two and their relationship is dramatised as opposed to fictionalised I m not sure but within Sorkin s script they both work well Fincher also delivers and makes the film feel cinematic despite its very talky and chair bound nature He produces great shots sets the scenes well and produces good performances throughout Eisenberg stopped being the poor man s Michael Cera for me with this as he produces a character that he really understands and gets into it isn t that he is saying the lines in a certain way so much as it is him being that character so that the rather bitter edge to him is always there even when the scene doesn t need it to be more than a shadow Garfield is equally good and does make a lot of the scenes with his more emoting character while Timberlake is great OK a rather swaggering character but he pulls it off well In support there are plenty of good turns from Hammer who does great with his two roles Mara Jones and others and the only ones that did distract me a little was Disney s Brenda Song and a totally silent Adina Porter True Blood who seemed to be in a character that one would normally just stick an extra in I doubt she was actually even in focus once during the film Anyway True Blood fan gripe aside The Social Network is as strong as everyone says it is It has the snap and pace that you know it will have thanks to Sorkin but it also has a strong base of characters and makes this tale of invention betrayal business and lawsuits into a fascinating and engaging character driven thriller of sorts The performances and direction are all on the money to make the most of this great script and the film does stand as one of the best of 2010 hopefully the upcoming Oscars will reflect that as well,
29 July 2013,Good but dragged out,Facebook and the Internet in general is a massive part of today s world so making a film on this subject seemed like an interesting idea The acting in this movie is very good Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield in particular two of the main characters The way the story develops is interesting and seems like it would be very realistic but I found myself losing interest just over half way through there is just so much talking and it feels extremely dragged out 2 hours is a bit too long Yes this is a good drama but I can t see why the critics have rated this so highly I guess its all about personal opinion For me this is worth a one time watch 6 10,7
20 September 2010,Fincher's best since Fight Club,I have been a fan of David Fincher ever since I saw Se7en when I was 13 I saw all of his films the following week and not one of them disappointed me That was back in 2003 I loved Zodiac and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button as well but he really knocked it out of the park with this one I was fortunate enough to see The Social Network at a screening on 9 16 10 for my college Eisenberg Hammer and Sorkin were there and did a Q and A after the film It was a GREAT experience All of them seemed excited about the film and rightfully so The film brilliantly tells the story of college students who go through hell with each other over the credit for Facebook and the damage that comes to all of them because of it The acting and dialogue were flawless Eisenberg Garfield and even Timberlake churn out performances that should get them serious attention come award time Fincher s direction is also perfect you can always tell a Fincher film when you see it because his visual style is so striking and The Social Network is no exception When this is released please go see it and watch a film that defines a generation and what the world has become,10
24 September 2010,Excellent dialog. Superb directing job by Fincher.,I went into this film with little or no hope By the time the movie was over with the Beatles Baby You re A Rich Man playing over the end credits I had a huge smile on my face I literally cannot wait to watch this again during it s wide release The lighting and camera work here is beautiful every scene and sequence is a joy to watch If Fincher hasn t already proved himself time and time again with his great films this one might be the one to seal the deal for him One sequence in the middle of the film features a boring rowboat race Fincher sets up the photography so beautifully that it feels like you re watching a painting come to life All the performances are excellent Jesse Eisenberg plays Mark Zuckerberg as a fast paced nerdy kind of jerk ish attitude and Andrew Garfield is his best friend Eduardo who at the beginning didn t mean much to me but I found myself rooting for him by the end Justin Timberlake is easily the weakest one of the three but he still does a decent job And oh man the soundtrack Trent Reznor deserves some kind of recognition for this It is amazing A lot of people say the movie sounds boring They cite The invention of facebook as an uninteresting topic I say don t believe that talk and check out this interesting funny thrill ride by Fincher and co,
27 January 2020,"As complex as a David Fincher movie can be, and probably the movie that defined this decade.",When this movie ends tells us that Facebook has 500 million users this was the figure in 2010 10 years later this figure was tripled and now there are more than 2 billion people registered in this social network it can be said that this film talks about the theme that defined this decade of 10s social networks although its height began in the 2000s it is obvious that its frenetic growth happened during this decade it could also be said that The Social Network defined the decade as Fight Club defined the decade of the 90s touching issues of importance and relevance of the time both making an accurate and deep portrait of their respective generations David Fincher creates a film as intelligent and cold as his main character although the story can be reliable and not yet since Mark Zuckerberg himself has said that the most accurate of this film is the use of his character s clothes the other characters in the story and even Sorkin and Fincher indicate otherwise The Social Network is not a documentary it can be taken as a work of fiction that recreates a situation of betrayals and pure frivolity does not give us information that we should take as totally correct since it has a certain tone of the famous Rashomon effect which is that several people testify to a fact until the original version is so eclipsed that it is impossible to find a truth among so many points of view This movie is undermined by pure irony Harvard s least associative boy with no knowledge about human relationships creates the greatest source of communication between people today and the film ends with the creator of Facebook himself waiting that his friend s request to be answered The direction of Fincher and the script of Sorkin make this film look like a thriller a dark thriller when in one of its many layers it is a film about envy and teenage immaturity one of the greatest qualities of the films of Fincher is that they are very complex and can cover as many topics as they want The Social Network with Se7en Fight Club and Zodiac joins the list of masterpieces created by the hand of David Fincher one of the artists more prolific of the seventh art Although I almost never talk about such repetitive themes as the interpretations in my reviews since it is obvious when the performances are good and not and most of the reviews say the same about that but this time the young actors who keep this movie afloat deserve a line of recognition or more,10
6 October 2010,"The desire to get laid earns him 25 billion, but he did not get lucky",Recently I got more and more annoyed by the fact that every site I went on wanted me to log in with my facebook account I thought that facebook was a site for people who wanted to get laid and I did not see the connection with my political views or opinion about a TV show so I saw no reason to join Also I had enough bad lays in my lifetime I do not need any more When I heard all that Hallelujah about the Social Network movie I went to see it in the hope of understanding the younger generation and facebook better My reaction leaving the theatre was mainly relief that I am not young anymore The representation of life on Harvard campus and in California did not look like fun to me Especially the way the girls were depicted was nauseating I found myself confirmed that facebook was originally created by boys who wanted to get laid and that becoming a billionaire is easy nowadays if you find a way to promise social contact to enough lonely and desperate people It is the same principle they sell deodorants silicon breasts hair transplants botox cars make up wonder bras Oprah mouth wash fashion Viagra porn alcohol Dr Phil drugs etc with The only ones who get lucky in this game are the sellers not the buyers The good message of the movie was that all the money in the world cannot buy that so much desired social contact I found myself frequently checking my watch which is not a good sign while watching a movie The acting was good the guys were all supposed to be a holes and they played that role quite well The movie had a somber look to me and sometimes there was so much background noise that I had a hard time to follow the conversation How sad that 500 million people have to join this site to get some social contact,3
30 September 2010,"I ""like this""",Director David Fincher s The Social Network stars Jessie Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg and depicts how he became the billionaire behind the popular Facebook website We start with the humble origin of the site s forerunner as a prank Mark pulls after breaking up with then girlfriend Erica Rooney Mara This catches the attention of the school s social elites who pitch their site to Mark only to have him leave the project and launch Thefacebook a site eerily similar to their concept But before anyone can grasp the situation Facebook becomes a phenomenon Along for the bumpy ride are Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield Mark s best friends and FB co founder as well as Napster founder Sean Parker played by Justin Timeberlake Tradition dictates that a film s protagonist or hero needs to be likable When the audience isn t rooting for the hero the movie usually falls apart Not true for The Social Network a movie that thrives on the disdain achieved by Mark Zuckerberg in this account From the start he is overtly blunt rude and careless with no signs of remorse Does this sound like a guy who would donate 100 million to a public school system The Social Network chronicles Marks efforts to hijack ideas and leave out friends It s a story about an antagonist Great performances abound Jessie Eisdenberg is a distant fast talking smart alec Andrew Garfield has a fantastic scene where his easy going Eduardo loses his cool and for once Justin Timberlake doesn t suck I m sure Sean and Justin mutually agree to his lady s man charlatan portrayal But the fun doesn t stop there The score by Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor s is reminiscent of Tangerine Dream and it lifts many scenes I think some people will be letdown to find that the story of Facebook is framed by legal hearings but there are some clever screenplay elements put into play by scribe Aaron Sorkin The Social Network is billed as a dark comedy but I found it to be a straight drama Almost every movie regardless of the subject has a lighthearted moment and that s what I see in The Social Network it s a drama that happens to contain some humor For instance it would behoove you stay on the good side of a twin who describes him as 6 5 220 and there s 2 of me There are times where the use of soft focus goes to the extreme and the mise en sc ne masks drug use Heck college students even sub out the f bomb for some truly awkward PG 13 retention dialog Cutting from an R to grab a PG 13 for assumed profits has never been this bizarre Even without showing a dollar The Social Network is a far more timely and engaging tale of greed and woe than last week s Wall Street Money Never Sleeps but still it would have been nice for the film to clarify how Facebook became so preposterously overvalued After all this is a move about some people you came into money and the audience never understand where the money came from Is it the movie of this generation Perhaps but that would be because this generation can t make an income from inventing a tangible product My distaste for Facebook may be obvious but I like this,8
13 January 2011,THE SOCIAL NETWORK: The Zenith of Privacy Deprivation,The amount of information about the film THE SOCIAL NETWORK driving it toward being named Best Picture Best Actor Best Supporting Actor etc etc etc can only be compared to the global blast of privacy invasion that the topic of the film FACEBOOK has caused The story of Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg acted with as much flatline self absorption as the character he portrays a compliment and Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield in the most sensitive multifaceted performance in the film and their brainy computer manipulated program that became the ruler of the computer universe is well told The fact that the idea was lifted from the Winklevoss twins recreated a la The Parent Trap concept by one actor Armie Hammer and Harvard sidekick Divya Narendra Max Mingella provides the story driver here the history of Facebook is told through back and forth sessions at the depositions for law suits alternating with transmission of the incidents of the developmental struggles of the toy It is story of obsession of the fragmentation of trust between friends of the proliferation of a challenging brainy idea into a billions of dollars scheme and it is a documentation of how the current state of mind of the students to adults feed on gossip and instantaneous information dissemination the results of which we are only beginning to appreciate as individual privacy becomes a relic Ben Mezrich s book The Accidental Billionaires as been transformed to the screen by writer Aaron Sorkin and director David Fincher Seven 1995 The Game 1997 Fight Club 1999 Panic Room 2002 and Zodiac 2007 The Curious Case of Benjamin Button 2008 As with his other films Fincher successfully creates an atmosphere that captures the message of his films Here that atmosphere includes degrading women drowning dialogue with inordinately loud music on the soundtrack courtesy Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross maladaptive behavior and the gradual loss of dignity of those young people who propel this concept of Facebook to success not the least of which is a study of Napster Pro Sean Parker well played by Justin Timberlake This is a long loud noisy crude roller coaster ride of a film that probably is true to the mark as a docudrama and as terrifyingly thought provoking Grady Harp,3
14 July 2021,Doesn't hold back,or the evil behavior of Mark Zuckerberg part one This film really needs a sequel to cover everything that s happened since 2010 It s very well made but I have to say it s hard to like anyone as they re all so flawed including the Harvard elitists who came up with much of the original concept the CFO who was a nice enough guy but deeply unqualified for his position and Sean Parker at least in the portrayal here with his narcissism and partying They re all multibillionaires today so it s hard to feel too sorry for any of them And then of course there s Zuckerberg whose moral failings are apparent throughout from his misogyny and arrogance in college to backstabbing people along the way He is a complete a hole and I liked how David Fincher didn t hold anything back while telling the story I wish it had been truthful about Zuckerberg s personal life as Priscilla Chan is nowhere to be seen but the gist of the film seems right particularly given what would happen in the decade which followed Seriously let s have a part two,8
26 August 2013,"A visual information streaming without any real cinematic, artistic and emotional effect",It is surprising and quite shocking for me that most people appreciated the work David Fincher had done especially the style the approach the pacing the editing etc The Social Network is a cinema free and art free movie also I didn t consider it as an entertainment film The Social Network has no heart and soul it is almost impossible to feel anything about anything happening on the screen including the characters I didn t hate the main character as I didn t like him either but the problem is not the character I can t see any artistic touch or cinema feeling in this movie It was like just story and dialogs nothing else so I found the movie mechanic See Fincher s other works especially his early period there is a huge gap between those and The Social Network As for entertainment personally I was not entertained but also I don t think that this movie intended to be entertainment If it was then it is a failure It was impossible to be entertained for me because of the pacing of the movie and probably it was literally the most exhausting movie I have ever seen in my life Not only the characters speak too fast but also the pacing of the film This editing style course of events with no break is something I really hate as a moviegoer like that shaky cam and if you ask me it doesn t add brilliance to the movie The another main problem of the movie is lacking of any message depth or social commentary I had expected a thought provoking film and I can easily say that Benjamin Button includes much more themes messages and comments on life than The Social Network The Social Network has no background think about a movie without a background just the story the characters are there and dialogs This is such a movie so the movie doesn t let you feel anything about anything I saw a lot of biographical movies but haven t seen such a film before If things such as cinematic experience dramatic structure heart and soul character and story depth etc mean a lot for you like me then prepare yourself for a poor and very exhausting cinematic journey Unfortunately some great directors like some great actors lose their talent even if not they don t make great movies as they did in the past such as Brian De Palma Steven Spielberg Ridley Scott Tim Burton etc and as I a big Fincher fan it is too hard and painful for me to say this but Fincher is now one of those names either Considering David Fincher s career it is like before Panic Room and after Panic Room By the way I really liked and enjoyed Panic Room but it was the transition movie of Fincher Personally I prefer the period before Panic Room because I wasn t that impressed by the movies he did after Panic Room In this movie if Fincher did something brilliant I couldn t see what it is A smart movie for me is something like 500 Days of Summer If in the history of cinema there is any other movie similar with The Social Network in terms of style with real pacing problems that could be Syriana but even Syriana was a more important film than this if you ask me despite I wasn t impressed by that movie either I would have wanted to see scenes from life scenes from Facebook users lives some social and psychological comments and the most important relationships I don t know but there is one thing I am sure about that which is it would be very interesting and useful to see such a film for every of us Then what is the point of this film Just to give us some information If so this is not cinema The Social Network is a visual information streaming just that,1
17 August 2021,The modern citizen kane,Same moral same character arch It feels lazy to reuse this plot but it s mind bending how well it works,10
4 October 2011,All films written by lawyers are really about lawyers.,A bright social misfit Mark Zuckerberg becomes a billionaire by coming up with a new and radical way of communicating with friends and colleges through the internet But was he the complete and total author Before I even saw this film I congratulated David Fincher and his production team for even touching this theme So recent a piece of social history The protagonist has the deepest pockets imaginable so the film is clearly guided by lawyers and legal advice The usual flashback he said she said bomb proof air raid shelter Mostly based on court deposition Not only was the film virtually written by lawyers they feature on screen more than they need to Loyalty free parasites all of them I don t think many people will want to see this product twice and over time the high IMDb rating will shrink Why Because the soup is too thin We know he did it what we may not know is how he did it Once this is learnt in the broadest who do you believe strokes then there is not a lot to return to Credit Jessie Eisenberg for playing a slightly autistic virgin loner who clings to the wall at parties but clearly untrue He not only had a girlfriend before his life went bang but he is still with her today Movie convention dictates that all programmers are geeky social misfits usually wearing glasses held together with sticking plaster They stopped short of this here but clich is not avoided Programming is a slow business Like working in treacle To show his skill he hammers away like a speed typist But most of programming is debugging He never got it right first time Although to be fair only programmers know this and the audience has no interest in such nuts and bolts Quality acting by lead Eisenberg and especially good support from Justin Timberlake as theft is good Napster founder Sean Parker who really is quite adept at playing flash character roles Lost a lot of weight to make himself look younger The movie contradicts itself is when it claims that Zuckerberg has no real interest in money Especially when most of his actions show that he wants to cut the cake more and more in his favour and earlier makes himself scarce rather than having to lie Cowards lying Like Bill Gates featured in cameo I don t envy him because he is not cool and in reality money above a certain level cannot improve your life Not unless your only ambition is to build a hospital in the Third World Like many I came to this film looking for information and what I got was mostly opinion and spin At worst it clinks and clangs in its ball and chain However I was entertained for a couple of hours and that is really all we should ask of a film,7
30 March 2011,"Considering I am 'old' and a history teacher, this movie isn't exactly geared towards me...",My review is best read and understood in context I am 46 years old and in the Facebook world that makes me OLD and an ex history teacher so what I liked and disliked about the film is not what the average viewer would think This isn t meant as an insult just that I know I am not like the typical demographic for whom the movie was made I am very computer savvy for my age but that still makes me a dinosaur compared to a teenager or 30 something person The fact that I have never had a Facebook account alone makes me an odd ball So when I see the film I do NOT wax nostalgic about the good ol days of 2004 or 2005 Additionally as a history teacher I CRAVE accuracy in films and tend to nit pick them far more than normal For me history is like the Bible you don t embellish it or interpret it is IS truth So a younger person seeing the film with me would find me insufferable as I would look for the flaws and ignore the bigger picture So I did some research and found that the film makers did NOT intend for a historical account of Facebook but wanted to craft an exciting story that people would love And to do so personalities were changed and facts were omitted or ignored My biggest problem is that in reading about Facebook s founder Mark Zuckerberg while he is no angel nor does he seem to be as the movie strongly implies a sociopath with Asperger s Syndrome I was also a psyc teacher trust me on this this is exactly as the film portrays him And although he is exciting to watch in the film Justin Timberlake s version of the fonder of Napster isn t exactly spot on either So if you can ignore the artistic license what are you left with in The Social Network Well for 46 year old guys like me not a huge amount or at least not as much as I might have hoped based on all the publicity the film received Yes I liked it but didn t love it I liked some of the acting again I ll mention liking Justin Timberlake something I NEVER thought I d see myself putting in writing and the rest of the cast were good I also loved the way the twins were magically created using computers and a single actor cool But the story didn t engage me that much Yes I know they are all rich as can be but other than that I just didn t get it And as a middle aged fart I guess I wasn t intended to,7
17 January 2011,This movie is over rated,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,1
9 October 2010,Over-hyped,he Social Network about the intrigue surrounding the founding of the fantastically popular website Facebook perhaps you ve heard of it is a fine film but not a great one That s a little disappointing considering that David Fincher Seven Zodiac Fight Club is the director but the movie isn t much more than a run of the mill history movie about a subject matter websites that s not particularly compelling In 2003 Harvard undergrad Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg Zombieland creates a quickie site called Facemash which takes head shots of female coeds and puts them side by side allowing male users to rate which one is more attractive This crashes the Harvard network and brings him to the attention of one of the many posh elite clubs on campus whose leaders the Winklevoss twins ask Mark to create a social networking site for them but open only to Harvard students This in turn leads Mark to create Facebook itself rather than the Harvard oriented site It also sets off a chain of events that would eventually make Mark a billionaire albeit one sued by not only the twins but by his own best friend Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield the company s CFO The movie s how it all came together theme is interspersed with legal proceedings both sets that put everything into a sort of current context What caused Eduardo and Mark to be at odds Do the twins have a chance of defeating Mark And how does Sean Parker of Napster Justin Timberlake fit into all of this More than 500 million people use Facebook presently It s no longer a haven limited to college students My mom s on it If my grandparents were alive they d be on it as well It s a hugely successful tool in so many ways small businesses can use it to keep in touch with their customers friends can find their friends anywhere in the world people can catch up with old classmates and so on It s highly intuitive and very user friendly and it s all free Making a movie about a website can t be easy A website isn t three dimensional it s not exhilarating to watch someone create one The Social Network is simply not an exciting movie although it tries really hard to be one It attempts to show that the intrigue and back stabbing that occurred behind the scenes of its rapid rise into the zeitgeist is riveting fascinating stuff But when the movie was over I didn t know much more about Mark Zuckerberg than I did going in to the theater and what I learned about Facebook itself was just trivia On top of that the legal stuff that s always in the background is just dull no matter how many snide answers Zuckerberg gives to opposing counsel We re not talking about the Scopes monkey trial here On the plus side we do get a terrific performance from Eisenberg who shows he s not just another schlubby always a victim actor the role has some real heft to it and he s amazingly up to the challenge particularly with the rapid patter that always seems to be coming from Zuckerberg s mouth Other than that though this is almost a generic origin story about a subject that s really not interesting enough to warrant a full length movie,6
2 October 2010,"Overrated, But It Stays With You",I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,6
19 October 2010,Unlikable Kids All Speak Like the Same Person.,If you like Sorkin s writing and would like to see a film of unlikable kids all speaking as if they were channeling him then you may like The Social Network If you like movies with a non stop score through pretty much the entire movie and if you like NiN you may appreciate the way the filmmakers are trying to give the film some sort of life The Michael Cera actor is the same as he is in all his films but not nearly as enjoyable Can t really comment on the other actors but Justin Timberlake seemed uncomfortably out of place Female characters were basically non existent If you know the basics of the story then there are no surprises there it s about the Facebook founder There are also some litigation and party scenes plus several dorm scenes That pretty much sums up the film,5
10 January 2011,By Far David Fincher's Best Work,This film offers what purports to be the true story of Mark Zuckerberg the founding of Facebook I suspect it is fairly accurate as it is based on court documents What may seem like a simple story of geek innovation is also a story of theft betrayal and the rise of modern social networking technology Jesse Eisenberg is amazing as Mark Zuckerberg How accurate he is or any of the actors are I do not know But his geek genius and social ineptitude are clear and I think that is spot on Eisenberg was the right choice for the role as no other person has the geeky vibe but can be a very serious actor as well as comedian Justin Timberlake is also great as Sean Parker Timberlake does not act often but when he does I am often impressed he was great in Black Snake Moan for example Maybe being a talkative big shot is not a stretch for him but he pulls it off and gives me a whole new perspective on Parker a man I have somewhat admired Though I admire Shawn Fanning much more and viewers should not confuse the two the film does not make this distinction clear I had no idea he had any involvement in technology beyond Napster and I find it odd that a geek would be so party happy though I guess he worked more on the investment end Kevin Spacey produced this film and I love him for it Spacey is an amazing actor and I am glad to see him move into the realm of producing not unlike George Clooney if I am not mistaken Trent Reznor was also involved on the music end Fincher has long been a Reznor fan so I think this is a perfect choice and Trent nails the score I am surprised his involvement did not get a bigger notice David Fincher has been a great director for years Seven is obviously his masterpiece and even the troubled Alien 3 is decent Zodiac was a great telling of a classic true crime tale I think Social Network might be the best yet though While Seven is his best overall it suffers from not being a film everyone would want to watch This one is more universal and very timely especially with Zuckerberg being 2010 s Man of the Year If you have not yet caught this one do so now I suspect it will get a handful of Oscar nominations and maybe even a win or two Fincher s dark visions brought the world of Silicon Valley Oh yes,9
30 January 2014,Cold And Soulless,It took about a minute for me to know I was not going to like this film The male character Mark Jesse Eisenberg a Harvard University computer geek addresses a college age girl sitting across from him in a pub In an annoying voice and with all the warmth of a dead computer he speed talks his way through what is supposed to be a romantic date As the plot moves along Mark morphs into a kind of juvenile Gordon Gekko obsessed with his work greedy self satisfied and unconcerned with the welfare of anyone but himself With the possible exception of Eduardo Andrew Garfield almost all other characters including Mark are cold as ice selfish and downright soulless The Harvard University President is portrayed not only as obnoxious but also unethical Basically the script consists of a thousand villains and no one to applaud One really good line of dialogue stabs like a dagger In a scene where Mark sits in a conference room staring at his laptop as usual a female legal assistant named Marilyn asks him What are you doing Checking in to see how Facebook is going in Bosnia To which Marilyn responds in a tone of sadness Bosnia they don t have roads but they have Facebook The cast is too big Acting is acceptable given the heartless subject matter Visuals overall are too dark Sound quality in some scenes is terrible Filler scenes could have been edited out Trying to be hip The Social Network cashes in on the success of a contemporary internet fad Twenty years from now the film not only will be dated it will play like some relic from antiquity Either that or humanity will have been replaced by soulless robots exchanging notes with each other in code through some ghostly Orwellian hologram called Bot book,2
6 October 2012,PBS Documentaries are more interesting,This was a complete an utter borefest The previews made it look like it was fun informative and maybe even a little bit sexy Guess what It wasn t The story about Mark Zuckerberg is an interesting one so you would think a movie about it would be interesting I was wrong Unless your idea of a good time is sitting around doing calculus while a bunch of other nerds talk about calculus this movie is a complete waste of your time Just wait for a documentary to come out about it or read a book it is bound to be more interesting and exciting Basically this is also a movie assembled by Zuckerberg s spurned former business partners and enemies and is indeed a pretty unflattering view of the man Jesse Eisenberg played the part of the socially inept Zuckerberg pretty well if he truly is the annoying person that the film portrays him as In fact if you were to make a movie about an annoying geek Eisenberg would definitely fit the bill and I m not sure he is very far off from that character Justin Timberlake plays the only interesting person in the whole movie the creator of Napster but he is barely in the movie I should have known this movie would really be a disastrous borefest but I didn t realize David Fincher was the director With the exception of Se7en and Fight Club most of his films are unwatchable This is a good movie to put on if you are trying to put grown adults asleep before their bedtime Otherwise just put the DVD down because the studio should pay you to sit through this,2
11 October 2010,"Just as Fincher gave us the definitive Generation X film with ""Fight Club"", he and Aaron Sorkin give us a definitive Generation Y film...",and that s The Social Network It joins the ranks of his best and just like many of his his previous works has been reviled before it was properly understood For months before it came out it was the laughing stock of people who were off put by the idea of a movie about Facebook even though it s easy to look and see that it s about the founding of Facebook and the people behind it just like Fight Club is dismissed as a violent film about people fighting or that Se7en is just a serial killer movie Not to get sidetracked though The Social Network is filmmaking and storytelling of a high order that shows the grand irony of a socially inept Harvard student named Mark Zuckerberg who ended up creating one of the largest social phenomena of the twenty first century and love Facebook or hate it it most certainly is that The story works as an engaging fascinating character study at the beginning of the story Mark is a socially maladjusted reject and even after several million friends and a few billion dollars later he remains pretty much the same The outstanding acting style and direction as well as the great script armed to the teeth with sharp dialogue is what people are likely to miss by dismissing it as a mere Facebook movie Even if it were just a movie about Facebook why is such subject matter off limits Things that have become a large part of our culture shouldn t be reflected in our art Or is it because of that That technology is such a scary thing and needs to be dismissed The indisputable fact is that everything that s going on with social networking and the world of the Internet is incorporated into the ideas of a certain corner of history this one which will be remembered as such and The Social Network may very well be remembered as a film to define that era So please this is one of the films to see this year Don t get hung up on the idea that it s just a silly Facebook movie or else you ll be missing out on an excellent picture,
23 July 2011,Lets End Everybody's Facebook Obsession Now Folks,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,1
22 August 2020,Impeccable Script and Incredible Direction,It s been a while ignoring rewatches since a movie has left me as speechless as i am now i m about 10 years late to the party but right from the first scene i was at a loss for words the flawlessly written dialogue the perfect editing and the shockingly raw performances made me so excited for this movie and to say i wasn t disappointed is an understatement it s been a LONG time since a movie has sucked me in like this one has and it s definitely been some time since i actually felt sad when i saw that i was already halfway through a movie as the tension on screen grew so did my admiration for this MASTERPIECE and its unparalleled pacing captivating storyline cinematography and soundtrack and my lack of sympathy for mark zuckerberg oops,9
16 September 2010,"Can the ""Facebook movie"" be one of the best of the year? Yep, it sure can...",The Social Network was an incredibly engaging film that while mainly revolving around the invention of Facebook and all the problems that the creators encountered both before and after all was said and done really focused in on ideas and feelings that can be and are universally felt through all people the primary example being trying to fit in Everyone wants to be accepted I for one have never met a single human being that has wanted to be a loner and some will do whatever it takes to get that sort of attention which tends to lead into bad consequences In a year where movies have received some of the lowest critical ratings as well as box office earnings in recent memory The Social Network was while haunting truly refreshing and ultimately a triumph in all aspects whether it be considering the acting script or directing It was a fantastic movie that shouldn t just be among the best of the year it s so much more important than that It defines the entire social networking generation and that is one hell of an accomplishment Everyone can relate to it one way or another and that makes it one of the must see pictures of the year,10
2 October 2022,I Like the Film More Than I Do Facebook,I was slow to see The Social Network with the cast and subject matter it just didn t interest me I m glad that I did finally give it a viewing because I found it quite entertaining It s a solid ensemble cast and Eisenberg is particularly strong He successfully creates a truly unique character that is nerdy insecure selfish condescending smug and a total jerk and yet one that we want to watch The scene where his girlfriend Rooney Mara simply and deftly explains why girls don t like him is pure gold I m curious to see how The Social Network will stand up to the test of time but for now I found it very engaging and worth checking out,8
16 December 2010,What a trash...! If u got brains simply avoid it!,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,2
1 December 2011,"Who cares, and more importantly, why????",Cinema students rejoice Here is an American film worthy of critical analysis and close examination Its camera work is at times stunning The acting performances are worthy The direction is tight and focused all the while entering some new territory regards narrative structure The sound was daringly attempted albeit not wholly successful So why just six stars Because with all the film s many technical and artistic high points and there are many I just didn t care It didn t entertain me I understand that many folks might find Mark Zuckerberg s rise to Facebook CEO interesting however I suspect that a good many more people will not I am among the latter About eight years ago former San Diego Union Tribune movie critic David Elliot wrote eloquently of a movie s need to personally reach a viewer s psyche before the individual can embrace it Providing entertainment is the goal of all movies I fought against this thinking most all my life I wrongfully assumed that a film could be judged on its artistic merits alone with no consideration given to its ability to make a personal connection with the viewer Even if the connection was unexplainable and strictly visceral the movie must make an emotional and personal impact on the viewer for the film to be a success The viewer must be entertained Well this movie is an example of Elliot s observation The film did nothing for me It was one long dull and boring straight line in spite of its artistic touches I didn t care about Mark Zuckerberg before the film and I don t have any more interest in him afterward I wanted to like this movie Again there is a lot to like technically it gets an A artistically it gets and A but for entertainment value it struggles to get a D I hope you like it You may Everyone s likes and dislikes regarding movies are different I agree with Elliot in that films should ultimately be judged on a personal level after considering their artistic and technical achievements For my tastes I ll see another film for my entertainment dollar Afterall isn t that what movies are made for ENTERTAINMENT This movie is many things many good things but it isn t entertaining,6
9 October 2011,"Fun for about 2 minutes, just like Facebook",Here we have Jesse Eisenberg whose rendering of genius is to talk really fast in hurried clipped vocalizations Fine You know what it s better than Matt Damon saying How do you like them Apples So Jesse Eisenberg s acting is annoying But that alone only warrants going down to a 6 or 7 how have we gone down to a 1 Because this movie goes beyond being overrated It s not just overrated it s something like ordering a 100 dessert at the best restaurant in America and being served an empty dish save for a solitary blue skittle on it And all this after reading in the NYT that this restaurant had the best desserts in NYC I think any half wit could see what is really going on This pile of junk is being promoted by the mass media for some godforsaken reason that speculating upon would have me labeled a paranoid schizophrenic So I won t speculate on why the media fawned over this strangely moronic film as if it somehow foretold the second coming of Christ What I will say is that this movie is disingenuous crap that is filled with clich s racial stereotypes bigotry and elaborately staged scenes of sheer human idiocy surpassed only by Jackass 3 5 This movie warranted more than a 1 it s really a reaction to the hype the hype which is absurd at best and criminal at worst It s actually quite funny the way all absurdly overblown Hollywood movies are,1
31 December 2010,Sorkins web/back,If you have never heard of Aaron Sorkin you should seek out West Wing One of the best TV shows produced EVER Really great writing and smart plot combined I didn t know he was responsible for the script for that movie before I went in but I should have seen that coming or hear it in the dialogs Of course before all that was the idea of a movie about Facebook Or the Facebook movie as it was also called It seemed like a joke Until you heard the director attached to the project David Fincher Now why would he want to do a movie about Facebook I can t really answer that but I m guessing he read the book the main character of the movie wrote and he found something in it he liked Same must go for Sorkin His fast paced dialog might feel a bit distance for some But for those who came to love it they will really cherish every line spoken in the movie If the real deal is as clever and eloquent as Eisenberg who is portraying him Don t know but it s not like everything is made as an ode to the Facebook Founder And Mr Timberlake might finally get recognized as a real actor too He s earned it,9
6 September 2013,The movie this generation deserves,In a Frank Zappa interview he once discussed the changing music industry how it slowly went downhill due to executives not taking any real risks while thinking they knew what was cool or what the kids wanted in order to meet their bottom line He goes on to basically say that the current at that time decline in music quality originality is what our society deserves Since the masses obviously keep buying into the MTV culture where good art is more about looks money style than actual content I think Zappa s idea applies to this film and our declining society as a whole in terms of film music and the entertainment industry in general We deserve this type of tripe shallow superficial pop culture fad praising art that we throw gobs of money at each year This film is a cookie cutter what s cool now made for TV special with apparently a wild squirrel randomly jumping on piano keys for the soundtrack There are some solid performances here but overall it is too panderous to the contemporaries who will remember the rising popularity of Myspace 2 What is worse is that they didn t even make a Steve Jobs film until after he passed Jobs and company did a lot more to change the way we interact in all aspects of life Why did Facebook Zuckerberg need a 2 hour film about him even as the site s popularity was rising I guess because it s hip so IN right now They may as well start making films about eBay s rise to power the evolution of YouTube starring Justin Bieber as Chad Hurley Our watered down over hyping society is sadly continuing into a dangerous trend of accepting essentially superficial and empty products that all look the same but with a slightly different package Everyone wants to be a star or know something about stars Both desires just like this film do not result in anything worthwhile I give it 10 15 years max before Facebook becomes as relevant as Pet Rocks Gangnam Style If critics and audiences keep buying into this garbage it is certainly what they deserve more of,1
30 November 2011,"A masterful film ...""I'm CEO, Bitch""",The real life Facebook saga beginning and ending with Harvard University student Mark Zukerberg a computer nerd permanently dressed down in T shirts and a sweat jacket who turned one drunken night of blogging about his ex girlfriend into the top networking site on the web The success of Facebook an internet phenomenon currently worth some 25 billion dollars did not come to Zuckerberg easily what with his best friend and CFO squeezed out early on twin Harvard athletes and their business manager suing Mark for stealing their idea and Napster co founder Sean Parker appointing himself Zuckerberg s unofficial business manager Director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin adapting Ben Mezrich s book The Accidental Billionaires keep the past and present action moving lickety split no corners are cut though the duo speed so quickly at sharp angles that viewers could easily get lost in the shuffle if not paying rapt attention No problem as Jesse Eisenberg as the curiously ever complicated Zuckerberg gives one of the finest performances of the decade Supporting cast including Andrew Garfield Justin Timberlake and Armie Hammer playing both Winklevoss brothers are excellent as well Films like The Social Network which are predominantly made up of conversations over action run the risk of becoming bogged down in talk or worse repeating themselves Fincher is highly adept at creating inner tension within his scenario so that the picture is never boring and substituting visual thrills with vicarious thrills This is a smart prescient tightly edited piece of work one with the sting of defeat as well as the sting of success Winner of three Oscars Best Adapted Screenplay Best Original Score and Best Film Editing from,8
14 October 2010,"Great scripting and acting, and then what?",OK I m a tad prejudiced I had read most about the Facebook backstory over the past year and I think David Fincher is an over rated picture mash up maker Let s try to be objective There s not much to learn from the Facebook genesis Basically it s Fight Club without fist fights Nice elevator pitch uh If it wasn t for the 500 odd million people registered on The Social Network nobody would give a damn It Is Downright Anecdotal and Deeply Uninteresting But the scripting is brilliant All this uninteresting stuff just flows There s no gap no hang the known reality is perfectly blended in additional fiction to leave no unknowns behind only bright answers and nice half answers The acting is just perfect too So directing must be very good not As a project manager I can admit David Fincher is really good Yet since this movie will mean nothing 5 years from now whatever becomes of Facebook to the general public I can just acknowledge it is a very fine marketing product A somewhat good movie Scripting and acting keep you interested all along but there s absolutely nothing in it you would feel like discussing with your friends after it reaches the 2h mark when it s time to close shop So you may think David Fincher is a great director I just think he has a talent for building his team which is just half the job Spielberg is a great director he knows how to and has the means to build his dream team he gets all the funding he wants and still in every other movie he dishes out his trademark sentimentalism overflows David Fincher has no trademark he is great at nothing except feeling the breeze and setting sail at the right time No small feat no major achievement either In the end only a very small number of people are able to see precisely how much of a talents catalyst Fincher is and how much he owes to individuals talent and hard work Just like with Mark Zuckerberg,6
9 June 2012,Am I the only one who was angered by this movie?,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,5

1 October 2010,Will you be my friend?,Greetings again from the darkness This is a film with good genes It s based on Ben Mezrich s novel The Accidental Billionaires screenplay by Aaron Sorkin West Wing A Few Good Men and directed by one of the best directors working today David Fincher Fight Club Zodiac The film is dialogue driven and my advice is to shift your ears into turbo mode to keep up These Harvard types never stammer and are quite speedy in making their oh so clever points This film is not so much the history of Facebook as it is a glimpse into the individuals behind the idea Foremost of course is Mark Zuckerberg played with rapid fire tunnel vision by Jesse Eisenberg The programming guru behind the code Zuckerberg is depicted as a guy who is not just socially inept but also unaware of social mores and code I am not sure if he is best described as a prodigy genius or even possibly a sufferer of Asperger s Syndrome Whatever he is was he became a billionaire in his early 20 s by proving he could put together the world s dominant social network while having no redeeming social skills of his own Fascinating Zuckerberg s best and only friend and business partner is Eduardo Saverin played by the next Spider Man Andrew Garfield Saverin fronted the money to get Facebook started and was one of the parties who borough suit against Zuckerberg claiming he was cheated out his place in the company The third key player is the infamous Sean Parker played by Justin Timberlake Founder of Napster and Plaxo Parker manages to get his hooks into Zuckerberg and apparently was behind the snubbing of Saverin This is the most charismatic role in the film and real life yet also the role that may have the most dramatic license taken The story is told in non linear form weaving multiple depositions from different lawsuits One includes the Winklevoss twins from Harvard who claim Zuckerberg stole their idea They later settled for millions As I said this is not so much a history of Facebook as it is a display of the characters involved These are all brilliant people who are also ignorant to the ways of the world It seems they all have significantly different goals yet never really stop to agree on strategy Instead the growth is non stop as is the back stabbing Interestingly the film uses a girl Rooney Mara in the opening scene as the single biggest influence on Zuckerberg s brainstorm Her rejection of his self centered speed talking kicks his wheels in motion and his relentless energy never slows for the rest of the story One thing is clear Zuckerberg did not single handedly create Facebook and there is little doubt some key people were given short straws along the way No matter what really happened as all that was battled out behind closed records in the settlements What we do know is that Facebook now has over 500 million users worldwide This is an extremely well crafted movie though in my opinion none of the acting is up to the script It s a film that provides enough insight into the players and enough entertainment for the ticket That s really sufficient Coming next David Fincher is set to direct and Rooney Mara is cast as Lisbeth in the Americanized version of the fabulous Swedish hit The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo So enjoy this one and look forward to that one,7
23 February 2011,Friend THIS,I don t think this has any business being nominated for Best Picture it felt like a Movie of the Week to me or maybe an HBO Original Film Definitely not worthy of a theatrical release and MOST CERTAINLY no Oscar contender I went to see this only because I make it a habit of seeing all Oscar nominated films and key performances so that I can really enjoy the awards show I knew going in that I don t give a rat s behind about Facebook and feel that social networking is destroying not enhancing our culture Suffice it to say that the actors did a good job talking way too fast and mumbling half their lines perfectly depicting the Facebook Generation Glad I saw this via NetFlix and didn t spend 20 at the movies,2
16 August 2013,Slick product of a cynical age,Hollywood seem to have forgotten that to make an emotional investment in a film and this is a long one about 2 hours we have to care about the characters and their story Script writer Aaron Sorkin slickly moves his puppets about and has them say archly cynical things in his usual way but by the end the audience feels nothing but indifference Really Hollywood thinks we all want to see a bunch of privileged entitled people screw around then screw each other and we re supposed to care These shallow self interested people may be typical of Hollywood and obviously connect with the critics who were almost unanimous in their praise but in the real world people are more concerned about paying their bills not worried whether entitled person A from Harvard sues entitled person B from Harvard for xx million dollars Huge efforts have been made to make The Social Network as slick and self consciously cool as possible so those suckered in the hype can delight themselves as to how smart they are getting it The dialogue is sharp if unnatural typically Sorkin and delivered in rapid fire fashion sometimes as in the opening scene hard to follow but the fans of this won t admit that because that wouldn t make them smart enough it is set in a subterranean darkness much favoured by modern films does nobody like daylight anymore it has a clever but dramatically distracting framing device and a soundtrack designed more to sell CDs as to work on screen from the awful opening plinky plonky piano tune representing what exactly to the loud inappropriate underpinning of the various scenes of drug taking or programming the music makes no distinction between these activities In the end we feel this is a typical product of the post modern age slick shallow cynical derivative dark and disposable,3
25 April 2017,Boring film about a narcissist,This film won loads of awards is loved by the critics and is popular with audiences I was given the impression that it s a fast moving witty film with great characters I was disappointed that it s dull and that its protagonist is a very unlikeable narcissist I don t know whether or not it s an accurate depiction of Mark Zuckerberg but it s not an entertaining portrayal It seems that the audience is meant to side with and root for him but that s difficult to do because of how selfish and arrogant he is,2
12 January 2011,Why should I care? This film doesn't tell me.,As one of those who completely fails to appreciate the inherent narcissism that underlies Facebook as well as its clunky confusing interface I was disappointed that Aaron Sorkin completely failed to make me understand why I should have any interest at all in the story he tells What I saw was a story about a social incompetent who screwed over several people and somehow blundered into something that made him very very wealthy but in the end had no effect whatsoever on who he was as a person Classic drama is all about how the central character faces a personal crisis learns important lessons and comes away changed in some fundamental way In this film that just doesn t happen It s just a story about an unpleasant person who created this thing that appeals to people s least interesting characteristics made a WHOLE lot of money but came away from it pretty much the same person he was when he went into Boring Just like most of what I see on Facebook What was really disappointing was that given Sorkin s powerful work on The West Wing I was expecting some profound reflections on what effects this shallow person has had on society That might have been an interesting film too bad it didn t get made Instead we get a navel gazing look at someone who made it possible for millions of people to make their navel gazing public Just like Facebook this was mostly just a major time suck and I left wishing I d done something more important with the last two hours of my life,2
17 November 2020,It's a good movie although I must say I never thought it was as great as some perceive it to be,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,6
2 October 2010,A very good but flawed film.,You re not an asshole Mark You re just trying so hard to be one This statement uttered by a lawyer played by Rashida Jones describes David Fincher s The Social Network quite well It is not a great film but it is trying very hard to be one That being said it is certainly a good one When it was announced people reacted to the idea of a film about Facebook similarly to a Transformers film being made For the most part all the write ups about the film were filled with cynicism and negativity To people s surprise Aaron Sorkin would write and David Fincher would direct Following its premiere mountains of praise were heaped on the film which for the most part was deserved To me this film is hard to review On the surface there is much to praise Fantastic performances great cinematography and direction with some great writing yet I come out of feeling nothing There was an emotional disconnect between the film and me something was lacking The film is exceptionally well made it has great style and Fincher deserves a lot of credit for what he has done However the problem I had was I didn t care about the characters Mark Zuckerberg played by Jesse Eisenberg is not meant to be a hero in fact he is portrayed as a prick Someone constantly condescending due to his insecurity and superior intellect We are not given any characters that we can attach ourselves to which isn t always a problem but the story was told in such a way that it didn t suck me in either The performances are great across the board and most surprisingly the stand out for me is Justin Timberlake who disappears into his role He plays Napster creator Shawn Fanning as a slightly delusional paranoid entrepreneur Aaron Sorkin like David Mamet or Quentin Tarantino has a very stylized way of writing dialogue It either works for you or doesn t Fortunately it did work and some very enjoyable exchanges are present in this film The problem isn t with the dialogue but with the way the story is told constantly cutting forward in time to his meetings with his lawyers and the people suing him This gives the film an almost procedural feel and leaves me cold Fincher has made some very good films but never has he made a truly great one They never emotionally connect and I blame this on his style The film is beautifully shot but it is the way it is shot that I had the most problem with It is too clean too composed It is style versus emotion and style wins out It is quite obvious he started his career as a commercial and music video director in this film This is certainly not always a bad thing but on this film which needs us to connect with at least one of the characters the lack of emotion keeps me from really loving this film I will say that the final scene almost made up for it it is humorous yet strangely disturbing Unfortunately the ending came out of nowhere There was no build up it appears as if several scenes were cut leading up to the ending It instead uses text during the final shot to clear up all of the loose ends which there are many The film doesn t care about its characters and this proves it It may come off strange that I will still recommend the film but I do It is very good and interesting Certainly better than most of the films released in the last couple of months That being said it has flaws significant ones and for that it fails as a great film but succeeds as a good one For more reviews and articles about film check out my blog The Deleted Scene http thedeletedscene wordpress com,7
29 September 2018,Wow,Who would have thought this was the history of Facebook well I m sure it s heavily dramatized The director did an amazing job here as did the main cast The music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross set the tone so well and is great music to work out to incidentally As I m sure facebook will be around for a long time so too will the legacy of this movie,9

11 January 2011,"A movie about the founding of facebook, and the ensuing legal problems. I really enjoyed this, more then expected.I say A-",Movie about the founding of facebook was it stolen and the legal problems Zuckerberg Eisenbeg faced After his girlfriend breaks up with him Zuckerberg decides to get revenge on her by starting a billion dollar company I have to admit going in I really did not have any desire to watch this being that I m not into facebook I don t even have a personal facebook page Also from what I knew about Zuckerberg made me go in wanting to really hate the guy The first half I found it easy he was really cocky and only thought of himself I don t know how accurate Eisenberg s portrayal was but he was pretty much what I expected Has the movie progressed I started to feel sorry for him Facebook took off too quick and he was at the mercy of everyone he came in contact with in order to be liked For some reason when ever a movie takes over all media and becomes the place to be like this one did I have a feeling like I need to find something wrong with it so I can hate it like I do with Titanic different review but I found it difficult with this one I m not positive that it is good enough to win best actor or best picture at the Oscars but I would not be surprised if it did I really liked it much more then I thought I would I give it an A,8

15 January 2011,The Vidiot Reviews...,The Social Network Usually when a nerd invents something it is promptly captured decapitated and the stolen panties returned to the girls dormitory However in the case of this dorkenstein his creation was allowed to flourish After he is dumped a supercilious Harvard student Mark Jesse Eisenberg creates a vicious website that attracts the affluent eyes of the Winklevoss twins Armie Hammer After agreeing to program a social networking website for them Mark then takes their concept to his benefactor Eduardo Andrew Garfield and begins work on his own social network When the site launches so too do lawsuits from the twins as well as Eduardo The analysis of an asshole The Social Network is a profound film thanks to director David Fincher and Jesse Eisenberg s haunting performance And the best thing about communicating via electronic devices is that just like in real world conversations you never have to look away from the screen Green Light,9
15 December 2010,The story of a virgin.,Incredible Seems like all the mentally challenged adolescents waited for this one A stupid marketing trick for stupid people The real story of this movie it that of a virgin dork sick of playing with himself who takes up programming He does a good job makes a site that attracts a lot of no life kids then decides to use his money to get over the past experiences from high school by inventing a story about how he has a lot of foes I simply cannot understand what attracts people to this site and this so called film Furthermore I cannot understand how humanity can idolize a nerd just for giving lame kids a chance to meet boys girls Fabricated story lame result If your IQ is over 50 you can t enjoy this trash Over and out,1
3 October 2010,An unpleasant time had by all,It s a story of really despicable people making a lot of money If you are interested in making a lot of money too you won t find out how they did it by watching this movie all you will know is that Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in the US The flashback technique is used very ineffectively The scenes of depositions or whatever it is that is going on at those tables why aren t we told are unnecessary for introducing the next segments It seems to me that the movie makers while telling us about two lawsuits are actually only protecting themselves from a lawsuit They are trying to persuade us that the events in the movie true or false were presented in sworn testimony Who cares The story could have been better told straight forward Also if the flashforwards had been omitted there would have been some time left to let us see what happened that turned the company into a money maker The actors did a great job of portraying unpleasant human beings who destroyed everyone who tried to get close to them but that s not reason enough to see the movie,2

3 October 2010,The Youngest Billionaire In The World!,Before I review the film I would like to mention that I do have Facebook account and its sole purpose is to allow friends who I have lost touch with and who live all over the United States and the world to find me if they want to I also have a extremely rare ethnic last name and no one in the entire world of 6 billion people has the same first and last name which makes my name unique so I carefully guard my privacy I have the barest of personal info on Facebook and the highest of security settings I also spend close to zero percent of my time socializing or keeping track of people I know through Facebook or other social networking sites Why As the Social Network makes perfectly clear Nothing but nothing takes the place of real live people in face to face relationships After watching Social Contract it left me feeling both amazed at Mr Zuckerberg s good instincts and his fortitude in not letting anyone hold him back and allowing himself to succeed beyond his wildest dreams and empty by his profound loneliness and from the persistent discord that swirled around him throughout almost the entire movie I also found irony in the fact that Mr Zuckerberg did not cooperate in any way with the making of Social Network because it exposed his private life to the world but yet at the same time the general public is encouraged to give him Facebook as much of our personal information as we can Social Network is interesting because you see what a person with good instincts can achieve in the real world While I don t approve of people mistreating each other the history of inventing anything important is full of stories like Social Network For example patent lawsuits are a big business that s why we have patent attorneys I also found it so delicious that the founder of Napster who brought the recording industry down on its knees played a key role in providing critical good advice to Mr Zuckerberg s success I know how malignant the recording industry can be None other than the legendary Nigerian drummer Baba Olatunji told me a how one the biggest record companies in the world viciously screwed him out of a lot of money Social Contract is mainly about two things Interpersonal relationships and money As far as the money part of the story is concerned Mr Zuckerberg is now a billionaire actually he s a MULTI billionaire With that huge amount of wealth I couldn t help but wonder what is he doing with all that money to make the world a better place At the same time I kept thinking about the 18 year old gay college student who recently jumped off the George Washington bridge because someone filmed and then posted his same sex sexual activities all over the internet He left his suicide note on Facebook I hope someone close to Mr Zuckerberg s reads this review and encourages him to start spending some money on organizations that work to strengthen laws that protect a person s privacy and maybe throw a few bucks to Gay Lesbian Bisexual and Transgendered GLBT Suicide Prevention Hotlines around the country also They are always struggling for money It would be a most profound gesture Mr Zuckerberg,10

13 February 2018,The director is the real star here! (no spoilers),This is one of the movie I had on my watch list for a long time and which I wanted to see almost ever since it came out I only had the chance now because I wanted to watch all the movies from the 2011 Oscar highlights list The Social Network tells the story of the Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg and how he created Facebook and later dealt with the problems it raised This movie is directed by David Fincher and it can be seen from almost the first shot The cinematography and the pace of the movie reminded me most about Fight Club because this is mainly Fincher s style of movie making This movie was a blast from start to finish I was captivated and drawn into the story from the first couple of scenes The movie is not shocking or with a lot of twists and turns but the way is directed feels like a live experience This movie is 2 hours long but it felt almost like an epic of 3 hours because the pacing was somewhat fast and there were a lot of things happening in it First of all the performances were all top notch especially from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield The cinematography beautiful along with the directing which in my opinion should have won David Fincher the Oscar The story is very realistic and extremely well told I mean it captivated me even though there were no plot twists or CGI extravagance and props to the screenwriter for that The only reasons I m not giving this movie a 10 are 1 The poster for this movie is in my opinion misleading in a way that makes you think that the movie will be about how unsafe Facebook can be at times but the movie is almost about something completely different 2 Some of the politics and laws were way to complex exposed in movie and it was hard at times to keep up with all of them 3 The score was a big let down Now I know David Fincher wasn t renowned for being a director who utilizes music score very much to enhance the quality of the movie example Fight Club but this score won an Oscar that year and compared to Inception s score which is the only one I know from the nominees that year is completely underwhelming I can t understand how they didn t gave the Oscar that year to Danny Elfman or Alexandre Desplat or other composers who I think did a better job than the composers for this movie did Overall A very interesting and captivating movie with terrific performances great direction but with a slightly misleading poster that made me believe the movie was going to be about something else some hard law science and poor score 9 10,9
18 August 2018,A rightly restless movie!,The thing I love about The Social Network is the flow of the movie resonates with the characters it depicts The movie proceeds with breakneck pace is raw visceral and restless much like it s characters Another reason why the movie works is Impeccable casting Jesse Eisenberg playing Mark Zuckerberg with an air of arrogance nails it Andrew Garfield is the most likeable character in the movie as Eduardo Saverin No one could have played Sean Parker like Justin Timberlake and Armie Hammer playing the Winklevoss twins is fantastic too We usually associate David Fincher with those dark psychological thrillers but this movie proves he is not a genre specific filmmaker he is much more than that,9
3 August 2018,A fascinating take on the origins of Facebook,The Social Network presents a fascinating take on the origins of Facebook and the social media craze David Fincher does a spectacular job of creating complex characters that go from despicable to likable and back in a matter of minutes From the story to the acting to the soundtrack this movie excelled I was surprised by how much I liked this film even with all the hype surrounding it,8
6 October 2020,Great Direction and Great Writing...All At Once,Quite often I notice a trend where two artists that I admire work together and then the film turns out to be unsatisfying it happened with Spartacus to name an easy example Yet somehow David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin managed to come together to create one of the best films of the last decade creating a kinetic experience with Sorkin s trademark dialogue yet with a mastery of tone that can only be attained by a master such as Fincher I can t entirely pin the film s success on just Fincher or Sorkin a film is created by many different people people such as actors editors cinematographers composers and so on Yet it is nice to see that all of those threads come together to create a complete whole of an experience The Social Network is often a film I point to when I discuss films that so admirably binds these threads together and in a way that seems effortless Everything in this film works from the acting to the writing directing editing and even the music Some scoffed at the idea of Fincher being the director of a serious film considering he had become known for directing crime thrillers such as The Game Zodiac Panic Room and my favorite of his Se7en which I prefer far and wide over his 90s opus Fight Club but Fincher shows that he is not a one trick director and can explore other genres effortlessly His sense of tone and atmosphere is not lost in this film though I do miss the grungy dirty look of his earlier work I find that he still has a remarkable sense of style and place throughout the film I sometimes joke that his newer films always look like a bar or a nightclub yet nonetheless Fincher manages to create a moody melancholic tone that pervades throughout the film I am reminded of one of my favorite television shows Breaking Bad while watching The Social Network Much like Walter White Mark is primarily motivated by ego and insecurity and many of his decisions are based off of his personality Mark isn t a very nice man and he s actually quite horrible throughout the film Yet the tragedy of the film is due to Mark s short sighted decisions and his allowing his emotional insecurity to define his actions and cause him to burn bridges with the people he cares about as well as allowing toxic people such as Sean into his life due to him playing to Mark s ego and manipulating him to his side The faltering of Eduardo and Mark s relationship also has to do with Mark s ego as well as Eduardo s own insecurities and jealousy of Sean The acting of the film is exceptional with show stealers being Jesse Eisenberg Justin Timberlake Andrew Garfield and Armie Hammer in a dual role as the Winklevoss twins I was particularly impressed by Hammer s dual performance as the Winklevosses and that he shows his range by giving the twins distinct yet differing personalities The exceptional acting gives life to the characters and their decisions are what defines the narrative Justin Timberlake and Brenda Song also have turns that show their range as actors and they re not bad in the film at all One of The Social Network s great strengths is its use of non linear storytelling by editing Much like Soderbergh s The Limey the film comes together through its use of non linear editing without seeming disjointed or confusing I m still in awe by the way that Fincher and Sorkin managed to work together to create a cohesive whole The way that Sorkin plays with words is always something that s impressed me and the way that Fincher compliments Sorkin s vigorous script is to quote George Lucas like poetry This is also apparent in the film s use of similar lines editing back and forth seamlessly through different time periods while saying similar things to each other The music excellently crafted by Nine Inch Nails Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross also adds leifmotifs in the film that makes the dramatic impact much more effective as the film rolls along The Social Network s influence has seeped through not just films but also through pop culture and our understanding of Mark Zuckerberg Zuckerberg and some of the other people depicted in the film have criticized the film as inaccurate but I don t think they got the point of the film The film isn t a documentary but a reflection of our times and one that I found to be more poignant and reflective than many other films that attempt to do the same thing Fincher said that the film was the Citizen Kane of our generation and in many ways he s right Mark much like Charles Foster Kane is a victim of his own mistakes and one who craves love yet often sabotages his chances of happiness due to his insecurities and ego and is unwilling to admit to his mistakes or face the consequences of said mistakes until it s far too late and now must live with the consequences of his actions He s hollow at the end not unlike Kane or Daniel Plainview yet is just as powerless as he was at the beginning I can only sit back and think of how rare it is for a film that manages to combine so many factors together successfully and The Social Network should be a pointer for how to bring ambling threads so cohesively together,9

1 May 2020,The Social Network,Wow This film is absolutely phenomenal If you re looking for one of the best films of the decade this is a prime example Easily a top ten favorite for me,10
1 November 2020,The Best David Fincher Film!,The Social Network is a film written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by the legendary David Fincher It documents the rise of the popular social media network Facebook and we follow the creators Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg and Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield in the journey of establishing this well known website The acting is absolutely brilliant especially from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield who convey the rivalry between the two main characters fantastically This was the first big film for Justin Timberlake playing Sean Parker who is great in his role and it is very surprising that he is able to hold his own along side Eisenberg and Garfield The screenplay is exceptional which shows off the sparkling writing You wouldn t expect a story about Facebook to translate well to the screen but thanks to every person that worked on this film it is marvelous The story and dialogues are constructed very well and are spoken incredibly so they feel real David Fincher is amazing and in my opinion has never made a bad film Seven Zodiac The Social Network is very different to all of his other movies but it is easy to see the progression of his craft He films this picture with a contrast of light and shadows in order to create an atmosphere that he wants the audience to feel Overall this film is sensational it lands in every way and I highly recommend it to everyone,9

8 October 2012,all linked up,First I should admit that I can t verify the accuracy of The Social Network Nonetheless David Fincher s look at Facebook s origins is a very engrossing movie Part of the point that it makes is that Mark Zuckerberg clearly did some ethically questionable things on his way to becoming the first millennial billionaire Then again did anyone become a billionaire 100 ethically Jesse Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg as a nerdy but ambitious student taking an idea hatched by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss both played by Armie Hammer and using it to enrich himself He even antagonized his erstwhile friend Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield At least as portrayed in the movie The Social Network does come out really good The main question that it seems to be posing is how honestly any business has come about Of course people might not consider that as they spend all day on Facebook Definitely worth seeing,7

3 October 2010,The Social Network,The Social Network is based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich and follows Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg as he creates what is now one of the most visited websites and forms of social networking ever entitled Facebook The film shows the socially awkward and acid tongued Mark Zuckerberg as he creates the website and after time he keeps getting more and more members signing up and joining it and after it becomes a big success that is when the different lawsuits come out I am not a particularly really tech friendly person I know how to use parts of a computer and the internet but if you were to ask me to build a website from scratch design anything or anything to do with coding I am completely lost The Social Network does talk about how they create the site and some big technical words may come your way but it is not the whole film and doesn t leave those who are unfamiliar with it confused and not able to get into what is going on in the film There is so much I absolutely loved and adored about The Social Network that I will try and remember it all and get it into this review First off the direction is great Yes this is a Hollywood big budget movie but it does not feel like one Because the film itself is pretty dark the atmosphere and mood set by the director is more low key and has a haunting and at times macabre look to it that suits the going on happenings of the characters around When I talk about this I do not mean to say that The Social Network is a horror film but instead that in other ways it is disturbing and very dark and the dim lighting and use of what I guess would be fluorescent lights to give some scenes a haunting glow I thought was pulled off perfectly and set the tone for the film really well The script to the film is amazing for several reasons It takes a true life story that in the hands of another director or script writer could have become a fairly unoriginal biopic but instead it breathes life and there is so much energy here The characters or at least a lot of them in the film have very rich vocabularies and they tend to talk very fast but just listening to some of these conversations is fascinating because of the quick wit of some of the characters and what they say as well as some of the awkwardness around it as well because a lot of these characters have very poor social skills is that why they created a social networking site The script which goes back and forth from the characters at school to talking with the lawyers during the lawsuit is all absolutely fascinating and with the quick jump cut editing it feels fresh alive and something that we do not see all that often The acting from Jesse Eisenberg who plays Mark Zuckerberg is a brilliant performance because of his smug arrogance as well as his sharp wit and acid tongued speech to his social awkwardness It s all here in this performance and it s great At the same time all of the supporting characters do a great job as well The Social Network not only looks at the creation of one of the biggest and most profitable websites of all time but also shows the decline of today s youth The teenagers and young adults that are portrayed in the film all have huge egos and are really egocentric narcissistic and nihilistic They care for themselves and themselves only and in some ways will do whatever it takes to succeed In it s own way perhaps the creation of Facebook has led to some of this Instead of talking to a friend or family member on the phone you now all do it on Facebook and you lose that sense of personal touch and the relationship to the person The conversations one has on the internet or cell phones is a lot different than it used to be and illiteracy and bad grammar and English skills are on the rise and is some of these sites to blame The film also looks at these dangerously empty lives of these young adults who try and fill in what is missing with drugs alcohol sex and money but we see that they are never really happy and continue to lead an empty existence The film is a brilliant character study in that way I found myself loving The Social Network from close to the beginning right up to the end and the film lingered with me I thought about it and what I would tell others and say in this review about it The film is powerfully and masterfully made with an enormous amount of talent behind it Mark my words in years and decades from now The Social Network will still be watched and talked about by a lot of people and will go down in history as one of the best films of all time The way it captures the mood and feel of today s youth is brilliant and is a real eye opener while being tremendously entertaining at the same time This is one of the best films I have seen in quite awhile and I think it is safe to say also that it is one of the best films I have ever seen,10
30 October 2010,What did this guy do for humanity ?,The first fifteen minutes gives you a headache Typical Aaron Sorkin dialogs delivered at hundred words per second that not even the actors seem to understand The rest of the movie is half the rise not yet the fall of the Facebook founder and the other half is how people fight over money Guess who comes out as the smart guy giving the intelligent repartees during these trials Since Fincher is used to making films with violence and tension he fills the void with heart thumping music and scenes like half naked girls dancing to rap sniffing coke from a young facebook intern s belly Of the same generation Fincher would never equal in quality and subtlety with Michael Mann or Paul Thomas Anderson What did the Facebook guy do for humanity Why is he a hero Just because he is worth millions Wish they had made a film of Julian Assange This film Just sleaze,1
16 August 2018,Perfectly Directed and executed,This with fight club might be Fincher s best wotk yet Every scene contains a valuable piece of information It surely is a very stylish film and unique You won t find another film like this one because there simply isn t one,10
15 February 2015,On the thin divide of love/hate,This movie infuriated me made me want to rip my hair out and see Zukerberg burn for his greedy betrayal but that s also part of what made it such a success as a movie It s well written and directed so to evoke the maximum response from its audience and much like Jack Gleeson in his role of Joffery Baratheon in Game of Thrones Jesse Eisenberg manages to create such a loath able character that you find yourself as a viewer becoming more invested in the story hoping for the villain to be beaten by those who you sympathise with So while I found myself hating the based on real events story and some of the characters in it I have to tip my hat to the production team for putting together a good movie,8
5 September 2021,Is idea of making really stolen???,The best ethical point in the movie is Never forget those who stood along you and took your back in difficult circumstances when you were nothing and of course the movie is amazing with a great star cast especially Andrew Garfield performance is phenomenal,9
2 February 2022,"Trust me, never trust lizards!",Lizards are unreliable lizards are watching your life lizards are not respecting your privacy lizards are stealing your information lizards are using your information against you lizards are selling your personal information lizards are lying Even in court against the law The lizard is a thief He knows that we know Excellent soundtrack,5
15 February 2015,One of the definitive films of this era,While some may consider the comparison sacrilegious The Social Network is essentially a modern version of Citizen Kane it even has its own version of Rosebud and while it doesn t have the same scale of Welles film it s almost as good It s about the true story of Mark Zuckerberg who became the youngest billionaire in history after founding Facebook The film uses Zuckerberg s life as a metaphor for the ironic isolating effect social networks have on individuals He s desperate for genuine human connection but incapable of fitting into the world of the social elite so he invents a virtual way to crash the party which only isolates him even further from the society he wishes to be a part of as well as the few real friends he started out with It s an excellent film about capitalism s expand or die principle Every time Zuckerberg hits a roadblock in his personal life his answer is to expand the reach of the company in a futile quest to prove his worth The Social Network features a haunting score by Trent Reznor its dark tones establish a sinister atmosphere and prevent the perception that Zuckerberg s attitude and achievements are something to celebrate and Aaron Sorkin s script weaves together multiple narrative threads in a seamless structure David Fincher s film should be remembered as one of the definitive films of its era,9
21 November 2019,Fincher and Sorkin in top form,The Social Network is an immaculately crafted Facebook origin story and character study of Mark Zuckerberg that cuts to the heart or lack there of of what makes Zuckerberg played by a razor sharp Jessie Eisenberg such an unlikable guy It s an unflinching portrayal of a misanthropic social climbing opportunist who enriches himself by building a social network under the pretense of bringing people together and in the process double crosses his business partners and his only friend Eduardo Saverin an empathetic Andrew Garfield when it becomes financially and socially prudent Whether it s in business friendships or in any other relationship honesty is the trait we prize most Its what we look for in people we either hold dear or have close dealings with The Social Network is an unflinching takedown of the unfeeling opportunist at it s helm If you still have a Facebook account and have even the slightest urge to delete your account give The Social Network a watch It might be the cure you re looking for I d be remiss if I didn t mention that David Fincher masterfully directs Aaron Sorkin s great script and Trent Reznor s score is fantastic I also wanna say that the whole cast was really terrific,8
3 October 2010,Please stop making movies about j*rks!!,I wasn t planning on seeing The Social Network I love Alien 3 was blown away along with everyone else by Fight Club when I was younger and now find it to be nostalgic at best absolutely hated the adaptation of Benjamin Button and haven t really paid too much attention to Fincher otherwise I also don t have a Facebook page and haven t good things to say about Eisenberg But everyone else seems to be digging the film and Aaron Sorkin is one heck of a writer so I thought I d give it a go The film itself was average in quality No great highs and no great lows in my humble opinion The biggest issue for me though is more of a slippery slope I ve been noticing as of late of movies such as this coming out all about a slew of j ks or a oles as the Network itself would claim who no one would ever care about Back in the day it was all about the underdog the Brando schmo scratching at himself and wearing a dirty white T shirt It seems today though the new underdog is really just some selfish bozo whose only means of being empathetic according to the filmmakers is that he she might be a computer nerd or short or not so good looking As though that s enough to make us care about him her The specific problem for me with The Social Network is that none of the characters deserve any empathy or even sympathy at all The main character whether the real Mark Z is or not is a total narcissistic b ard who doesn t seem to even want anything or have any real goals aside from pi ing off his ex girlfriend with whom he seems to have no real chemistry or intimacy in the first place Just because he continues stalking her doesn t mean he cares about her I had trouble even believing that he would care that much about her anyway considering the inhibited introverted solipsist the movie made him out to be Then we have his best friend or ex best friend who was probably the only slightly sympathetic character in the film which in this case is like being Valedictorian in summer school But even he seems to be selfish childish and immature throughout using his family s money as a means of making or breaking friendships throughout the movie Everyone else in the film seems to be even bigger j rks than the character of Mark Z going around trying to intimidate their enemies and each other without really accomplishing anything or again wanting anything real except for revenge It s difficult watching a movie like this where there s no one to latch on to emotionally Justin Timberlake was surprisingly charismatic and charming throughout the movie but as much as I wanted to like at least him at least one character in the film his character was also so incredibly despicable and conniving not to mention somehow very wealthy despite everyone saying he had no money anymore that it became impossible I guess he was supposed to be the antagonist The villain to the other villain s Another issue with this kind of slipshod writing and filmmaking is that we re not granted any semblance of three dimensionality or humanity that can lend itself to realism Jesse Eisenberg might never smile and he never seems to in movies or interviews alike but I m sure Mark Z does In fact whenever I see that fellow in an interview or photo he seems to be smiling quite bright Maybe it s just now that he has 25b But come on Cheer up Charley Give us a smile An easy fix to this could have been involving characters from Mark s actual life to show the humane and more complicated side of his persona His parents for example Where were his parents He was 19 during all of this a minor His parents could have been injected into the movie to give a fresh and more complicated perspective of the guy to have them maybe speak with him and with each other about the scared boy inside the angry robot the movie makes him out to be Or his real life girlfriend who was there in those early days perhaps making a composite of this girl and the one dimensional Erica of the extant film A girlfriend who stands by him who caresses him and lets US in on the real Mark who SHE sees as opposed to again the robot the movie makes him out to be In the end Mark Z s character was just as bad a guy and just as hypocritical as the biggest blonde haired Adonis bully fratboy character you might find in an 80 s teen movie Just because he happens to be a nerd doesn t make him Louis Skulnick Charles Foster Kane wanted the innocence of his youth and craved that time in his life before he became Hearst And this is exactly what makes him more like us more of a character with whom we can empathize regardless of how venal he becomes over time Mark Z just wants to pi s off an ex girlfriend who again I don t even really believe he gives that much of a d n about anyway When there s nothing to care about in a main character a movie is failing When there s no characters to care about at all a movie FAILS Hollywood please take a memo You can t combine Revenge of the Nerds with Varsity Blues anymore J rks will always be j rks no matter if they re computer nerds alienated little eight year olds Southern working moms pregnant teenagers or fat Work a little harder to create real three dimensional characters we can care about There s always something there it s just a matter of finding it,5
26 May 2012,I liked it - a lot actually - but it came just short of reaching me on an emotional level.,Some time ago many people openly demonstrated their skepticism about the idea of making a film devoted to the Facebook founders but today and at this very moment no touch of irony is seen while the movie confidently enters the top of best flicks of this year So many passionate praises so many rosy predictions such high ratings So what s so great about The Social Network that attracts so much intent attention and exceedingly good responds I don t have the answer The movie deals with betrayal and greed and is recommended to everyone The film is not about how facebook was found but how all Mark Zuckerberg s relationships drift apart as he seems to go ahead,10
31 July 2013,You have part of my attention. You have the minimum amount.,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,
24 September 2010,Terrific and Thought Provoking,With 10 films up for Best Picture these days I think it is a pretty safe bet that it will get a nod but back in the days of 5 nominees I would really doubt it unless the winter crop of Oscar Contenders is a big disappointment Personally the only two films that I have seen this year that I enjoyed more were Inception and Animal Kingdom I have not yet seen the Town but as I said before I expect to see several more terrific films during the next 4 months I am not a huge Fincher fan I have liked every single one of his films I have loved none of them This is now my favorite Fincher film Since Zodiac he has really made fantastic looking films and this continues that trend Panic Room was my favorite film of his prior to this though I am sure I am in a minority there Eisenberg should really got nominated I haven t a clue if he can win but he was brilliant Every little nuanced scene he shined in I really believed his character It truly is his film I would like to see Andrew Garfield nominated for Best Supporting Actor as well He is one of those guys that I know that I have seen in a few things to date but I have never found him memorable However he does a wonderful job here and this should give his career a big boost I have always been surprised at how solid Justin Timberlake has been in his films to date and he does a great job here too Not as strong as either Garfield or Eisenberg though The screenplay by Sorkin was rock solid and will certainly get a nomination You have to wonder how a story about Facebook is going to translate to the screen The answer with all the talent involved is brilliantly The movie opens a sort of Tarantino type restaurant scene with Eisenberg and a girlfriend prior to the credits It sets the tone for the Zuckenberg character and lets the audience know that they are in for a fascinating ride One of the great successes of the film is to cause one to ponder just what an impact social networking has had on our society It really has changed the way people interact with one another And it is subtle but powerful In my opinion as a man who lived through the last cultural upheaval Hippies and Vietnam this is not for the better One last thing I must mention There are a very important set of twins in the story and I thought these guys are really good I wonder what else they have done I was totally blown away when I found out that the two guys who played the twins are not even related in real life I mean they looked exactly alike A lot of humor and a fascinating story I love a good character study and this was certainly rock solid in that category,9
17 December 2010,slickly made but relentlessly creepy,Being in the computer biz I was interested in some of the ins and outs of the rise to glory of Facebook This movie has the feel of truth as far as the character of the individuals depicted and what I know of the backstory But for me that was the problem Almost everyone in the film was creepy and despicable and the lesson I drew was that this is the way things work in the Brave New World of virtual friendships That s fine as far as it goes but by the time I escaped the theater I had a dank aftertaste in my mouth The dialog is pretty snappy I kind of liked the music but it was a bit overbearing in those big disco party scenes I try to avoid these in real life preferring to have conversations with people where I can actually hear and understand what that other person is saying I didn t have the choice here Too many scenes were just irritating to watch Is everyone at Harvard really a complete overbearing condescending superficial bore with an overinflated sense of entitlement Interesting scene with Larry Summers who has always struck me as one of these But it gets tiresome Who do you root for in this movie After more than an hour and a half I the only one I found was the girl from B U that called Mark and asshole and blew him off His partner is decent but hopelessly naive the other parties in the lawsuit are only marginally less creepy and arrogant than the main character Easily the most overrated movie of the year,3
12 October 2010,Anti-social networking,David Fincher does a marvelous job of telling a complicated tale pulling us in and riveting our attention he has a history of that It is curious that so called social networking began in such an anti social stew of class distinction intellectual arrogance and sophomoric personal viewpoints Jesse Eisenberg is excellent as the creator of Facebook However the amazing role in the film is that of the elitist Winklevoss twins I don t like to read too much about a movie before I dive into the audience so I had no clue that one actor Armie Hammer played both roles Seen side by side in numerous scenes there was even a thought in the back of my mind that the twins were close but not really close enough What a performance A supporting Oscar nomination will hopefully follow Distractions the glamorization of the party scene at Harvard I have my doubts Perhaps it was just a way of emphasizing the fantasy that the computer guys were hoping to obtain and the abrupt ending It was almost as if a studio exec had said well not bad but we re looking for a two hour run time And so slice stop rolling credit explanation as to outcomes A more natural ending would have been appreciated But the anti social nature of the networking is laid out brilliantly through the Mason of the Harvard undergrads to the coed user consumer wannabes to the don t care attitude of the Dean to the use and discard context of many of the relationships In the context of the suicide death of a Rutgers undergrad a few weeks ago after social network bullying this film accurately tells of our times and directly questions its values,9
20 February 2011,Rubbish film. Avoid.,The opening scene namely the one of the boy and the girl in the bar was pathetic The sound mix was so badly edited that I could hardly hear the dialogue over the intrusive music Add to this the fact that the boy spoke as rapidly as Woody Allen on speed it made for an instantly annoying experience and I switched the DVD off I won t be watching this film ever again no matter how good the rest of it is supposed to be The opening few minutes of a film are supposed to entice you in get you hooked make you care and want to watch the rest of the story unfold The opening few minutes of this film did the complete opposite it made me angry never a good thing where I m concerned because I just go B LLSH T and switch off the DVD If that boy speaks as rapidly throughout the film as he did in the first few minutes then I consider switching the film off to be a blessing Rapid dialogue annoys the hell out of me mainly because people just don t talk like that like they don t need to think about their response when engaged in conversation taking only a nano second before answering a question or responding to a prompt for opinion etc If this film wins any awards it should be for the worst opening 2 minutes of a film in the history of cinema,1
4 October 2010,"Revenge of The Nerds: A 21st Century ""CITIZEN KANE"" - A Damn Entertaining Movie!",I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,10
21 October 2010,David Fincher has proved that even a movie about the dawn of a social networking website can be interesting,Despite being a user of Facebook com I must admit I had some apprehensions about going to see The Social Network Even though Facebook is an internet phenomenon and even though there is plenty of history and conflict that went into the making of the multibillion dollar website I wasn t exactly ecstatic about seeing a movie about it A cyberspace network can be addicting in the sense that you can talk to your friends in silence and such and according to an article in Forbes last year Facebook is estimated to be worth nearly eight million dollars but just how interesting would we expect a movie about it to be Well director David Fincher has taken the story behind this incredibly popular website the stories of the people who created it and weaved a movie that runs about twenty minutes too long but is still quite engaging As the movie starts out Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg a nerdy pompous computer brainiac has been dumped by his girlfriend and in a fit of stomach stomped rage decides to humiliate her in cyberspace via a blog and a new website in which female Harvard students are ranked in terms of how physically attractive they are His trouble raising prank catches the attention of three other students who want his collaboration in producing a new social networking website which would later evolve into a multibillion dollar phenomenon and the source for vicious friendship splitting conflicts The Social Network is really held up strong by its creative forces Mostly because of the skills of director David Fincher who I am predicting will finally win an Academy Award next February and will most definitely be one of the five nominees Every single shot of this motion picture shows his craftsmanship and technical prowess He also shows that he knows how to pace what might otherwise be dull sequences by having them whip along quickly but still registering an effect He also has very good actors in his cast Jesse Eisenberg plays his character in an autistic withheld manner a young man torn apart inside but only revealing it under the most dire of circumstances Armie Hammer was digitally integrated into many shots so that he could play the twin Winklevoss brothers and he magnificently generates two separate characters Also credit the digital effects artists and the makeup department for making him look like two different people I was thinking really hard if I had ever heard of Hammer s twin brother until I saw the ending credits Joseph Mazzello also makes his biggest film since Jurassic Park as the brothers jealousy stricken comrade Andrew Garfield is charismatic and generates sympathy with his performance and Justin Timberlake chews up every scene he s in as Sean Parker another networking maestro There s also a small part by Rooney Mara as Zuckerberg s ex girlfriend and she does a wonderful job as well It is the combination of these talents that overcome some of the movie s shortcomings Looking back on The Social Network I do still feel that it would have done better as a television miniseries for that is the sort of feeling it generates There just is not the firm glue applied narrative structure that typically builds the foundation for a movie As such about twenty minutes of the picture sort of drags I must also confess that I only really cared for the characters because the strong performances and the spins the actors threw on them Save for Timberlake none of them had any really likable or three dimensional characters to work on In addition the screenplay is a little jumbled at times making it hard to determine at what point in time we are now setting ourselves It flashes back and forth too quickly and a straight storyline would have been better It s not in my opinion one of the best movies of the year but The Social Network is still a movie very much worth seeing Part of the reason is that I am still amazed that anybody even somebody like David Fincher Se7en could make a subject as seemingly droll as this become lively and animated I have no doubt that this movie will be be on the ballot lists for the Academy Awards next year and that its many overlooked talents will finally get the recognition they deserve,7
22 January 2011,No-one owns ideas,This is an intriguing movie still fresh in my mind despite having seen it some weeks ago I was surprised at the warts and all portrayal of Facebook s putative founder Mark Zuckerberg who being now seriously rich can afford the very best defamation lawyers A good alternative title would have been Citizen Zuckerberg though he apparently still lives in a nondescript suburban house and drives an old car Several points stand out First the film makers have rather ingeniously used as a framing device two separate court cases dealing with who really invented Facebook the social networking site which I am happy to say I do not belong to Second Jessie Eisenberg s performance as Zuckerberg is uncanny It may or may not be true to life but it is absolutely convincing His Zuckerberg is either afflicted with Asberger s syndrome or else is seriously weird yet somehow we connect with him Third his opponents in one of the cases are the egregious Winklevoss twins two of a vanishing breed handsome rich WASP boofheads with an unshakable belief in their entitlement to privilege They are also now seriously rich though just a few days ago they lost an attempt in the Federal Court of Appeals to overturn their 2008 settlement with Zuckerberg They are played by the same actor Armie Hammer who puts in two seamless performances Fourth Zuckerberg s treatment of his collaborator Eduardo Saverin which leads to the other set of legal proceedings is almost beyond belief Fifth all the litigation seems to be about a property right which does not exist namely the ownership of ideas though the lawyers try to dress it up by inventing contractual rights of doubtful provenance As a film however this one works very well The supercharged and chilly atmosphere at Harvard College where the super bright slug it out with each other and the super rich is superbly realized You may have allies but no real friends This writer has some experience of the law school at Harvard and it all rings true I m not sure the origin of Facebook can be put down to Zuckerberg taking revenge on the girl who dumped him Facebook was one of those things whose time had come though no one realized its full potential at the time The Winklevosses snobs that they were saw it as a Harvard only site while Zuckerberg thought the Ivy League colleges were about the total market though of course he soon discovered the world was his oyster,8
30 December 2021,Andrew Garfield is Brilliant in this Role,Wonderful performances from actors Great storytelling Honestly the only reason I don t want to rate the movie higher it because I would have preferred a truer diversity in casting Andrew Garfield was the heart of this movie and made it special I would have preferred an actor true to the ethnicity of the character person Besides that Jesse Eisenberg was hatable which is good since I don t think your supposed to like Mark Zuckerberg All of the acting performances are great Would recommend this film to anyone who like learning about real life events Armie Hammer playing twins is fantastic he does a great job of giving each twin their own identity and character with character development Justin Timberlake is incredible unlikable but provides a full performance,7
30 September 2010,One of the best films of the year.,It is not Citizen Kane but David Fincher s Social Network has the energy of young Charles Foster Kane descending with his wunderkinds to take over a newspaper because it would be fun So too Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg who has become the world s youngest billionaire by inventing Facebook This biopic chronicles his rise from an undergrad at Harvard where he and Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield begin a campus wide comparison of coeds that led to a global social network phenomenon Along the way Zuckerberg not destined to win any congeniality awards legally fights the upper crust Winklevoss brothers Armie Hammer who claim he took their idea and Saverin who didn t fit well as CFO Whether or not Zuckerberg contributed to Saverin s downfall is an important consideration in establishing Zuckerman s complicated character who not only comes up with winning programming but also must engage and disengage operatives as brilliant as Sean Parker Justin Timberlake the founder of Napster The opening sequences where the great ideas take shape on the campus are the most electric and closest to helping us to understand the workings of genius We learn he s a computer nerd and a workaholic who gets results just as Kane Welles did As in the latter cases we really don t know who these gifted entrepreneurs really are inside yet listening to their witty dialogue more like frat boy screwball comedy than ordinary repartee is the film s greatest joy albeit some of the words are lost in the race But it sure is fun trying to find out In the spirit of All the President s Men The Social Network is necessary viewing for those who want inspiration to start an enterprise and for those who just want an affirmation of the supremacy of ideas and hard work,
22 March 2022,Trying To Make Nerds Look Cool,There s something to be said about the muted palette of the film the subdued anger the actors try to play off slyly throughout and the intense slow zooms used and abused from the first scene but no amount of sleek and stylish film making will ever make Zuckerberg s story about blatant IP theft any more compelling than it already was not And no amount of hard edged attempts at covering for his character while doubling back to pretend to question his ethics will make him look like a genius,5
2 October 2013,This is a story of the founder of Facebook.,Mark Zuckerberg is the founder of Facebook He is a popular man today He makes this site when he is a university student This is a story about him and the process before Facebook being made This is so interesting story because so many people have the account of Facebook today and we can know the process before it being made I think this story is a little complicated Therefor it is difficult to understand the story In particular I cannot understand the last scene It is significant The music the tone and camera work are great However I don t like characters Mark is an odd fellow and he is not good person I don t like him This is so popular movie and I know many people who like this movie I think this is a wonderful movie too However I cannot understand the story Therefor I don t recommend you to watch this movie,4
20 September 2012,Socialising for Lonely Sad People,The irony of the Social Network is The guy who invented Facebook obviously had a reasonably high I Q Yet the people who use it you know those people who use the word awesome over and over and over etc etc have I Q s bordering on mentally challenged Those poor things believe they have an average of 130 friends They are the loneliest critters on the planet Anyway this is a slick flick Not a good movie but perfect for all the Facebook fans who went along to see it Jesse Elsenberg is brilliant playing the horrible distasteful Mark Zuckerberg It did well at the box office and must have made a fortune from the placement of well known bottles of beer Strictly a movie that does not require multiple viewings and a few years from now it will be forgotten,3
6 March 2011,Lullaby of nerdland,I wasn t all that impressed with The Social Network I didn t buy the whip smart dialog and the rapid fire conversations I thought the script was way too showy and too clever by half I ve heard Mark Zuckerberg speak He s not that articulate and he is definitely not that spontaneous I also tend to believe that his characterization while unflattering was very likely not unflattering enough More incredulously the movie portrayed him and those around him as cool geniuses untouchable by us mere mortals Indeed it presented the high tech milieu as if it was an endless array of wild parties and ecstasy fueled dance raves Nothing could be further from the truth I think you would get a more accurate depiction of Silicon Valley life from watching The Revenge of the Nerds for what it s worth Some high marks for the score and the cinematography are in order and the pacing and direction are competent enough It will be interesting to see what happens to this movie once the level of interest in Facebook subsides and the next big thing in cyberspace comes along My sense is that it will be seen as nothing more than a dated artifact whose once great significance will seem quite mysterious to future audiences,2
18 February 2022,A toxic combination of being a nerd and being arrogant,The social netwerk is based on The accidental billionaires 2009 by Ben Mezrich As Mezrich already indicated in his book the story is not a biography in the strict scense of the word but more a character study of Mark Zuckerberg In contrast to the book the narrative structure of the film consists of a series of flashbacks with a a lawsuit between Zuckerberg and some of his early business partners as a starting point The film is an exception in the oeuvre of David Fincher most of whom s movies contain a crime element In the film Zuckerberg stays first in Harvard and later when Facebook outgrows the campus in Silicon Valley In both instances Zuckerberg is a loner who stays away from the wild parties Parties that have much in common except for the fact that in Harvard they are celebrated by old money and in Silicon Valley by new money The main deficiency of the film is the lack of character development of main character Zuckerberg He is and remains a combination of nerd and asshole At the start of the film his girlfriend Erica Albright breaks with Mark and comments that You re going to go through life thinking that girls don t like you because you re a nerd And I want you to know from the bottom of my heart that that won t be true It ll be because you re an asshole Fincher spent a lot of attention that is takes to this scene Rightly so because it is maybe the key scene of the whole film At the end of the film in a famous last line Zuckerberg s lawyer says that it is better to settle the disputes because he will certainly make an unsympathetic impression with the jury She says You re not an asshole Mark You re just trying so hard to be After this conversation she leaves Zuckerberg All on his own he tries again to make a connection with Erica via his own network It is the only time in the whole film we feel sorry for him After the key scene with Erica I just described there is another important scene To take revenge on Erica Mark hacks the Harvard network steals the pictures of female students and makes the website facemash On facemash one gets random pictures of two female students and can vote which of them is the most sexy At the same time it was party time for his fellow students A busload of pretty girls was brought in and entertained the Harvard boys Tha revenge of Mark Zuckerberg surely was sexist but I am not sure if the campus party was not equally sexist These two important scenes are in my opinion the best part of the film Of course the screenplay by Aaron Sorkin is razor sharp during the whole film but with the terrible techno house like soundtrack the dialogues are often hard to follow,7
15 September 2010,Great movie,I saw this film at a free screening in Denver last night From the opening sequence you know you re in Aaron Sorkin territory His rapid fire dialogue and the that was then this is now editing is a little disorienting at first but you get used to it When Mark Zuckerberg breaks up with his girlfriend you have a pretty good idea of everything going on in his mind And yet the film portrays him in a sympathetic light Everyone was laughing at the hilarious put downs and one liners The best one at least in my opinion is a reference to the original Karate Kid All the actors are OK but this is Jesse Eisenberg s movie He convinces you of all the insecurities and doubts percolating in his character While his reasoning is usually explained with a gesture or a snide remark his confrontation with the Winklevoss twins lawyer lays out his true motives for being the way he is Rashida Jones character although minor is pivotal since she explains to Zuckerberg where he went wrong There are some brief digressions like Saverin s girlfriend problems which contribute to the 116 minute running time sans credits It s a little too long and David Fincher seems confident enough in the material not to indulge in any of his usual tricks I d say the film is a mix of Juno with Greenberg without the self conscious dialogue of the first or the nastiness of the second,
29 December 2010,The Binary Society,Title money and beauty are the three forms of aristocracy as director Preston Sturges once observed and they are the governing forces of our society Connected to all three forms are curiosity and jealousy Both are very powerful human emotions that give people a certain false sense of power and raison d tre Facebook the website phenomenon is primarily built on it Curiosity and jealousy intersect in unexpected ways desires are triggered via mouse clicks and somehow a whole new way of existence is created and released What s even more powerful David Fincher writer Aaron Sorkin the work of the entire cast and crew rounded off by an amazing score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross completely captured all the above mentioned aspects But the ultimate feat that The Social Network manages to achieve is to show to an entire generation of internet users that no life can be lead if identity is not based in reality Every life has a profile not every life is profiled to have a soul Mark Zuckerberg seemed to have grasped this and according to the film failed to choose the right side of this equation Now this is one hell of a movie,10
27 November 2010,Only the best it could be with such a limited structure,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,6
3 October 2010,Fact or mostly fiction the film is still a masterpiece and a must see!,The best reviewed film so far this year and early Oscar front runner THE SOCIAL NETWORK is upon us David Fincher one of my all time favorite directors directs this adaptation of the popular book The Accidental Billionaires A Tale of Sex Money Genius and Betrayal by Ben Mezrich from a script written by Aaron Sorkin who also wrote A FEW GOOD MEN THE American PRESIDENT and created the TV series THE WEST WING to name a few of his credits The book if you haven t heard is an account of how the internet social networking site facebook was founded mostly centering on the lawsuits that followed it s immediate success and the relationships of the people involved Jesse Eisenberg stars as Mark Zuckerberg the majority stockholder and Andrew Garfield co stars as co founder Eduardo Saverin The real Zuckerberg fought hard against this film s release in this form fearing it will tarnish his image and he denies it bears much factual bearing at all to real life events but the real Saverin was the main consultant on the book Fact or mostly fiction the film is still a masterpiece and a must see The story is mostly set in 2003 beginning at Harvard University in the fall and then flashing back and forth between court procedures involving the litigation battles over the ownership of facebook As the film opens Zuckerberg is dumped by his girlfriend Erica played by Rooney Mara who was just cast as the lead in Fincher s upcoming remake of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO Mark is so upset that he goes back to his dorm room gets wasted and blogs about her and then creates a brief internet site called facemash comparing Harvard girls to each other in ranking of hotness This gives him notoriety and he is approached by the Winklevoss brothers both played by Armie Hammer in addition to a stand in about programming an internet social networking site that would be exclusive to Harvard students in an attempt to help get them laid Zuckerberg leads the brothers on as well as their business partner Divya Narendra played by Max Minghella son of award winning director Anthony Minghella and tells them he s working on their project while coming up with one of his own facebook in an attempt to beat them out the gate He enlists the help of his best friend Eduardo to finance and promote his venture with the return promise of thirty percent of the profits and later Sean Parker played by Justin Timberlake the co founder of Napster Zuckerberg becomes inpatient with his long time friend Eduardo and tricks him out of the majority of his stock sharing which along with the Winklevoss dispute leads to the core legal battle of the film and the heart and humanity of the story I ve been a fan of Fincher ever since his first feature film ALIEN 3 which I ll admit doesn t match it s two predecessors but is still a very underrated sequel much better than the 4th installment as well as the ALIEN VS PREDATOR films He s been responsible for some of my all time favorite films FIGHT CLUB SEVEN and ZODIAC and he s one of the most diverse big name directors working in film today Here he demonstrates universally appealing thematic abilities like he attempted with THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON my least favorite of his films and I predict he ll finally take home a much deserved Oscar come award time early next year I also think the film will win best picture and screenplay Sorkin s script is so witty and brilliant it would be a crime if it doesn t win The acting is all very impressive as well and Eisenberg who I ve always been a fan of should finally be able to shed the poor man s Michael Cera image he s been labeled with by many I m a big fan of Cera but Eisenberg has been around longer and done much more serious and diverse work after this film s release the two should have no problem standing apart The supporting players are all more than adequate and the film s score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is mesmerizing It s still a little too early to over confidently predict but I m guessing no film in the next three months and definitely none already released will be able to top it come award time Facebook is probably the most popular and relevant invention in use by the majority of society in at least the last decade and for that reason many say they re not interested in seeing this film they don t want to further support mankind s biggest fad This film isn t really about facebook though it s a dramatic character study It s about two best friends who are torn apart by money and fame envy the desire to get laid and the desire to be approved and envied by others The film could be about the invention of anything and it wouldn t change much as long as the characters remained the same This is an intriguing amazingly fast paced character study with plenty of litigation battle action to keep anyone from falling asleep The movie is much more entertaining than it might sound and it has a lot of emotion and heart as well While the Zuckerberg character is appalling and hate worthy at times he s also a well intentioned and good heart ed person at other times He uses his show off smart ass pretentious nature as a defense mechanism for his insecurities and need to feel liked He s a flawed anti hero but a likable one and those are the most interesting in my opinion The character whether true to life or not is the relate able heart and core of the film and makes for one of the best stories if not the best to come to cinematic life

26 December 2010,Don't bother,This movie is annoying from beginning to end Zuckerberg is a thief yes but mostly he is a snot nosed smart ass arrogant spoiled little boy and a robot with no personality to speak of I think maybe students at MIT built him Either way he s a loser and so is this movie I had to force myself to sit in front of my computer to watch it Really the best part about it is being able to take in the lovely vision of the Winklehoses or whatever their names are as there certainly isn t any other eye candy in this movie Apparently except for the Winkelhineys everyone at Harvard is just plain ugly inside and out A waste of film and two hours of my time,1
18 October 2018,Nerdfood,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,10
1 October 2011,"High-profile, but overly hyped entertainment that might date quickly over time (maybe like Facebook itself?).",Internet site Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in Jessie Eisenberg s lanky shape is not a very sympathetic figure a fast babbling and socially awkward misfit who was dumped by his girlfriend and whose embryo of FB started out as a good looking girls ranking site as a pure act of revenge the same night as the break up Progressively his character traits extend to a reckless million dollar entrepreneur of an unparalleled success concept of social media Director David Finchers scriptwriter Aaron Sorkins interpretation jumps between the legal process in the present where his former college friends intend to sue the crap out of him mainly for stealing the idea and the skyrocketing rise of the Internet phenomenon in the past A solid high profile piece of entertainment with ear bouncing dialog and fine performances but it never takes off dramatically nor emotionally to the heights that a first class movie must do That visionary director Fincher is behind the helm is a bit hard to understand since the story is albeit highly paced unremarkably carried out and ultimately feels surprisingly flat and inadequate at this level of aim and talent involved one visual wow moment though is a rowing contest montage Maybe this is the catch it s most likely mainly made with the focus on the Facebook phenomenon being THE Zeitgeist No 1 thing right now and for that reason opportunity must be seized before it fades Zuckerberg s story might be interesting enough to film in the long run but his tale isn t over yet by far and this chapter might just have been made too soon Because to me this movie is good but does definitely not have the whiz or character fate interest to warrant all the hype and high praise surrounding it It wouldn t surprise me if it will date quickly over time as FB itself might be Trent Reznors cool soundtrack is an asset though 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe,6
16 July 2022,"Engaging Direction, Great Acting, But Not Worth all the Hype",What makes this movie work out is that it s 2 hours about the founding of Facebook with marvellous direction admirable screenwriting and great acting from Jesse Eisenberg Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake However if you re looking for something big and completely entertaining this may not be the best pick The Social Network looks back on the history and the rise of the popular social networking sight Facebook landing on Mark Zuckerberg being sued by two brothers who claim he stole their idea The cinematography itself even when you take away the sound is impeccable enough to immediately grab you Director David Fincher does a fantastic job as always in making sure every shot is visually compelling And it s not a history movie that unloads several minutes at a time of nothing happening Writer Aaron Sorkin makes sure each scene will engage a viewer and thanks to the performances especially from Andrew Garfield and Jesse Eisenberg the characters in this movie will hold your attention The problem is the production designing and executing of this movie is what deserves all the hype Although there s always something interesting happening and the big elements hold your attention for 2 hours it s not exactly as entertaining as it is surprising The film crew and the actual movie don t deserve any of the blame for Mark Zuckerberg taking but technically not stealing someone else s idea as the film is just to depict the rise and founding of Facebook If you liked this review check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews,7
6 October 2010,Advertising and critics demand we love a mediocre film for the rich.,The trailers are the best I ve seen the reviews eerily better making me wonder what cost more the advertising or paying off critics because bottom line is if Facebook were not popular you would not care at all about this film AT ALL People raving about this film are simply fooled by the trite joy that Hey I use Facebook and here are the guys who made it when the film itself is dismal I was hoping for another Zodiak and refuse to believe David Fincher had anything to do with this bland wreck It s a film made by rich people about rich people for rich people All characters are one dimensional with no arc Critics rave of witty dialogue but only three moments offer any you can see them online and save your money Any potential emotional conflict is COMPLETELY left out most notably sharing in any inward struggle the main character must have had to betray his only friend for no reason We are given blow jobs and cocaine over character growth and anyone we can relate to This film demonstrates two trends in Hollywood that in my opinion are destroying cinema first and most importantly is that if a film is based on a true story it need not tell a story well There are recreation scenes on America s Most Wanted with more character growth than this film A documentary would be more entertaining because we would not be expecting to sympathize and vicariously bond with any characters The second destructive trend in Hollywood is pouring advertising money into bad films It seems the better the film the less advertising money is put in because they know people will love the film for the film Here we are told from every ad and critic on the planet to love this film before entering the theater and the entire time watching it I sit there are say when is the part I m supposed to love or even care about I recognize a few smart lines from the trailer and the audience seemed to smirk at those but even the woman who pretended to be shocked by 22 000 hits over 2 200 had a sense of boredom and confusion in her gasp that reeked of doubt as to why should I care Why should anyone We ve been had,1
30 December 2015,Intelligent and well crafted biopic of the Facebook founder,Facebook has been held position as the most popular social media website for almost a decade beating other popular social networks like Myspace Twitter and one more popular towards the adolescent crowd Instagram This biopic directed by David Fincher focuses on Mark Zuckerberg the founder of Facebook and the story behind how it became the enormously popular social website it is today Beginning in the fall of 2003 Mark Zuckerberg played by Jesse Eisenberg is a student at Harvard University who is dumped by his girlfriend Erica Albright played by Rooney Mara Upon the break up Zuckerberg creates a website known as Facemash where users compare girls online based on their attractiveness The website s high traffic causes a breakdown in Harvard s computer network resulting in Zuckerberg to place under academic probation During this time he builds up a social media network known as Facebook which soon leads to a global success and lands Zuckerberg to a billion dollar business However he also faces conflicts with his friends in the process pitted against two lawsuits one by his best friend Eduardo Saverin played by Andrew Garfield and the other by two brothers both played by Armie Hammer who accuse him stealing their idea Thanks to the masterful writing by Aaron Sorkin and superb performances by its gifted cast this biopic sparkles the legacy of Mark Zuckerberg s work and the story behind the creation of the globally popular website Based by Ben Mezrich s novel The Accidental Billionaires the film introduces us to the main character in the opening scene as someone not too likable due to his attitude towards his girlfriend and later his friends His ways of running his newly founded business leads to him squeezing his best friend out of business and making more enemies in the process So Mark Zuckerberg is proved to be have been not the most desirable person to work with but very intelligent nonetheless Jesse Eisenberg brings such a sensational performance in what becomes his first Oscar nominated role of his career He looks so natural in his role that you almost forget its him instead of the character he is playing Andrew Garfield who plays the main character s best friend that later turns into his enemy brings satisfaction to his role as well Let s also not forget Justin Timberlake playing Sean Parker the founder of the computer sharing service Napster who later partners up with Zuckerberg in his business The story works exceptionally well from start to finish and the elegantly written screenplay by Aaron Sorkin should be credited for this The film gently highlights the important points of the story based on the events that took place and though there a few noticeable liberties taken from both the book and real life events Sorkin keeps the story solid and satisfying without overdramatizing or sugarcoating the events The whole subplot dealing with the lawsuits against Zuckerberg are lavish the storyline and director David Fincher handles this subplot in a solid manner The Social Network is one of the most intelligent and well crafted biopics ever put to screen and demonstrates some of the best filmmaking from David Fincher This is an A film that everyone is strongly encouraged to watch regardless of they are users of Facebook or not,10
13 November 2019,Good Movie,Social Network is really good I would highly recommend it It s very dark for a movie about business You wouldn t expect a movie so dark about Facebook Trent Reznor does a great job with the score it s magnificent 7 stars,7
8 November 2019,Informative and carries an important message,It s hard to believe that it s been almost a decade since this film s release Since then Facebook s grip on people s lives only seems to have tightened and Mr Zuckerberg s public profile has grown significantly In this social media dominated age this film was definitely necessary and it provides an informative and compelling insight into the story behind one of the biggest invention of the modern day The Social Media is a well constructed film that gets the balance between educating and entertaining about right The characters are the most interesting part of the film and I thought they were brilliantly portrayed by all involved This film while primarily aiming to tell the complicated story behind Facebook also carries an important message no amount of friends on social media or money in the bank is a substitute for real life friendship The sooner people realise this the better I deleted my Facebook account many years ago now and don t miss it one bit My problem isn t just with Facebook rather social media as a whole and the in my view mostly negative influence it has on people I don t think I ll ever understand why people feel the need to broadcast their lives to the world but that s a rant for another time,7
22 October 2010,This is more then just 'Facebook the Movie',When it was first announced that there going to be a bio pic about Mark Zuckerberg and the creation of Facebook it was seen by many as a quick cash in on the popularity of website But luckily Aaron Sorkin wrote the script and David Fincher was setting in the director s chair and that made The Social Network one of the most highly anticipated film It is clear that The Social Network is going to be one of the big hitters at the Oscars this year though my preference is for Inception The film tells two stories that are interlinked The first from 2003 when Mark Zuckerberg Jessie Eisenberg as a Harvard undergrad who after breaking up with his girlfriend Erich Rooney Mara has a misogynistic rant on the internet and make a website FaceMash where men get to rate Harvard female undergrads against each other When he gains notoriety the Winklevoss Twins Armie Hammer recruit him to make a website but he ends up making his own website with his best friend Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield But as Facebook grows Saverin believes that they need to make money out of the website and Zuckerberg falls under the spell of Sean Parker Justin Timberlake the founder of Napster who wants to isolate Saverin In 2007 the film tells the two lawsuits Zuckerberg is facing with the Winklevoss twins and Saverin both suing him Sorkin is a great writing and The Social Network shows his skills and usual traits of quick intelligence witty dialogue intelligence well developed characters and quick pacing and excellent plotting using the legal proceedings as a framing device The film sets out to show that Harvard is controlled by social elites with misogyny raging in the Final Clubs Sorkin was unable to speak to Zuckerberg so most of the script was a fiction but it was an entertaining fiction Fincher s direction added to the script keeping the film down to Earth and Jeff Cronenweth s dark cinematography adding to the tone of the film Fincher kept the film in the real world and unlike Oliver Stone who tried to be stylist with Wall Street Money Never Sleeps a film that was difficult to make visual Fincher takes a more gritty realistic tone Fincher and Sorkin shows that Harvard can be a sleazy place with heavy drinking drug taking and treating women as no more then sex objects but there are also intelligence people there and people who disagree with what Zuckerberg did Fincher and Sorkin make a fast paced entertaining drama with moments of comedy There is a very good young cast in the film Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg almost like he was autistic a young man with great intelligence but almost no social skills who as Erich said But you re going to go through life thinking that girls don t like you because you re a nerd And I want you to know from the bottom of my heart that that won t be true It ll be because you re an asshole which is true in the context of the film Zuckerberg is a shown to be a man willing to steal other people s ideas and concepts use people and string them along and hides behind computers becomes horribly bitter if anyone dares cross him and the internet because his lack of social skills Hammer has a tough job of playing twins and two different characters and he puts it off Both men are from a wealthy background and felt wronged by Zuckerberg Garfield is a strong performer playing one of the few truly sympathetic characters of the film someone royally screwed over by his one time friend Before the film Timberland did not have a great reputation as an actor but Fincher was able to get the best out of him and show he can be a good acting talent Sean Parker is made to be the real villain of the piece a man who looks a like a 30 year old who wants to be a uni student a man who speaks pretentious rubbish about the internet and what he did with the music industry a man who used Zuckerberg Sorkin worried that his characters would not sound real because of their age but Sorkin knows that everyone is an individual and have their own speech pattern Whilst there is slang that every generation claims for themselves most teenagers and young adult speak the same as everyone else and it great that Sorkin makes his young characters sound intelligence Language has not changed much between generations and if anything the internet has made it more universal With all the good things about The Social Network I am critical of their portrayal of England in a short sequence going through all the posh stereotypes of what an American would think England is like I would have expected better from Fincher and Sorkin who are both intelligence men and well travelled Also it was a shame their didn t use the Kolacny Brothers and Scala version of Creep in the film Overall an excellent film and deserving of most of the praise it has received,9
11 November 2010,Stupid Film. Stupid Webiste. Stupid People.,This movie shouldn t even exist Why would anyone bother to watch this just too see some jerk making money off of people s names I just hope silly thing fecebook and all of it s negative social aspects social means dumb nowadays will appear in a movie next to Stalin and other dead characters I just want to be clear films like this aren t worth the time to watch them instead of watching a film about some people imitating some people that follow stalk some other people you would better get out and get some exercise or better yet Shoot Yourselves Tenth Line Goes Here,1
23 June 2023,Worst Soundtrack Ever,The Social Network is a vastly overrated film in my opinion After waiting years to finally sit down and watch it I was very disappointed to find this lauded film to be unwatchable I had to stop 10 minutes in due to the awful music stressful vibe annoying dialogue and mannerisms of the lead character I won t be watching it again 1 10 rating And the Oscars further discredited themselves by awarding Best Music Oscar to this film This was one of the worst soundtracks I had ever heard in a film up there with Death Wish 2 and it wins an award for that Is good taste really that subjective,1
15 June 2019,Embellished and solid movie,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,9
2 August 2013,"I hate Facebook, but this film is the best of this generation.",No other film I feel captures the basement dwelling computer hacker community more realistically I would say it s the most realistic portrayal of University life but I would be talking out my arse as I ve never been It captures a whole sub genre of people so incredibly well and the writing is as such that we can feel these characters as real people with real struggles and personalities and not just some nerd robots who pumped out a website Mark Zuckerberg as depicted in The Social Network is a bad guy He betrays people he lies he talks over his dear friends he cheats and he s the best at it The dude isn t even 30 yet and he s built an empire bigger than you or I could ever build yet he doesn t care He has no real friends He has build a multi billion dollar empire and for what I dislike Facebook but Facebook is also very popular This was the perfect opportunity to make whatever kind of film you want dark edgy slow witty depressing comedic etc as long as it has the background of Facebook and you re still bound to make loadsamoney off it And that s what Fincher Sorkin and Spacey did This is the smartest most genius and wittiest film of the past 20 years only just surpassing There Will Be Blood and Juno Eisenberg is pure gold as the fast clever cynical Zuckerberg even though he doesn t seem to be all that bad He talks faster than his own thoughts and often says mean and nasty things without even thinking they re mean and nasty until seconds later He acts superior to all his friends and he is superior mostly When he isn t superior to the rest he will strive to be betraying all in his path This isn t about money for him he just wants to be the best at something And he is the best he s the best at hacking lying betraying and yes creating What stands out for me is the soundtrack which can only truly work for a film like The Social Network Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross redux In The Hall of the Mountain King as a symbol of the old traditional ways being shunned in favour of the new generation and at the helm of the Battery Human Generation is Mark Zuckerberg,10
12 October 2020,10th anniversary!,In a dingy and nondescript college town bar a fastidious snide and awkward kid is emasculated by his girlfriend who is breaking up with him At this moment around the world the same thing is happening to a lot of young people but this is no ordinary end to a relationship This break up is the spark for an idea that truly changes the world and is now worth hundreds of billions of dollars besides It is the Fall semester at Harvard 2003 and the student getting his balls busted is computer wizard Mark Zuckerberg The Social Network provides a fascinating glimpse into a pivotal time period in the life of Zuckerberg who ultimately turns this rejection into a colossal corporate juggernaut instant stardom and billions of dollars The film is not a biography but something more compelling It revolves around a time when Zuckerberg is just making a name for himself is being sued for ripping off other people and is most vulnerable to being influenced for better or worse Characters are introduced in novel and intriguing ways as Zuckerberg himself is We meet the founder of Napster for instance awakening after a one night stand Ambient street sounds of traffic footsteps and random conversations contribute to the film s vibe of authenticity The Social Network is not a typical college life story Instead of focusing on dysfunctional fictional slackers who stumble upon a fleeting drunken and hazy sort of happiness there are real and ambitious young people seizing opportunities that will bring them riches and power beyond their wildest dreams Larry Summers former US Treasury Secretary is no bumbling Dean Wormer In one hilarious scene Summers the President of Harvard while Zuckerberg was there totally humiliates two arrogant and privileged students who come to enlist him to take on Zuckerberg Still as in the fictional stories much happens by chance Like getting people to willingly share their personal information instead of hacking it or having a broken relationship serve as the genesis for a social media behemoth and massive fortune,9
31 May 2020,"A semi-accurate history, but a transcendent movie",When I first saw this film in 2010 I definitely recognized Sorkin s brilliance and Fincher s craftsmanship always but I kept getting distracted by accuracy questions Why did they change Zuckerberg from socially awkward to the most confident and eloquent nerd ever Why did they leave out his then girlfriend and now wife How much of this story was true Revisiting the movie in 2020 was very different and not just because Zuckerberg feels more and more like Eisenberg these days I was able to just watch it as a movie This film tells a company s origin story through depositions and flashbacks That should not work But it does From Resnor s score ramping up the intensity to the brilliant pacing cuts to the pitch perfect performances of Sorkin s dialogue this story just cooks No matter where you come in you HAVE to keep watching And for once Sorkin s resists explaining his theme through speeches over and over You just see the way connection and isolation coexist for the main character and honestly for yourself It is all pretty brilliant and it was worth a second watch for sure Is it accurate Somewhat Is it a great film One hundred percent,9
23 February 2014,Fincher-Sorkin-Eisenberg-Garfield-Zuckerberg,Starting in 2003 Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg with the help and money from his roommate Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield first create a website called FaceMash where pictures of female students are pitted against each other to create a ranking This got him into trouble with the school and recruited by Divya Narendra Max Minghella and the Winklevoss twins Armie Hammer to work on their social networking site However he ends up launching his own site with Saverin which would eventually be known as Facebook with the help of internet entrepreneur Sean Parker Justin Timberlake Zuckerberg and Saverin would fall out leading to the lawsuit which is the basis of the flashbacks Everything starts with the collaboration between director David Fincher and writer Aaron Sorkin The snappy dialog from Sorkin sings off the lips of Eisenberg Fincher s directions infuse the movie with energy And Garfield creates humanity in his character This Zuckerberg is a stand offish awkward creature with full knowledge of his superiority It is an unique character and an unique film,9
2 November 2018,Mark Zuckerberg,Mark Zuckerberg is an asshat that made an ungodly amount of money selling everything about you to everyone that would by it all while smiling and pumping your kids full of ads Go ahead and kiss his ass some more,1
23 June 2011,The Social Network was one of the more compelling movies from the last year,Just watched this movie on Netflix with my mom While I don t think this was one of the best movies of last year True Grit and The King s Speech were more worthy to me The Social Network was certainly quite an attention grabber what with the speedy dialogue from Aaron Sorkin David Fincher s going back and forth from the depositions to the actual if a little fabricated events that lead to those court scenes and the performances of Jesse Eisenberg as the co founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg and Justin Timberlake as that Napster founder who charms his way into being one of the investors Another compelling performance was that of Andrew Garfield as the embittered co founder of Facebook who ends up suing Zuckerberg because of the latter s betrayal So on that note The Social Network is well worth the viewing,9
11 October 2010,Bumper sticker philosophies,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,
24 May 2014,One of the Best movies of 2010,David Fincher s The Social Network tells the very interesting story of how the popular website Facebook was created by the youngest billionaire in the world Mark Zuckerberg The movie stars Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg who was perfectly cast as his character for the film Although the movie was not only historically accurate I thought of it as Jesse Eisenberg s best performance yet Director David Fincher really knows where his facts came from for the movie and the screenplay by the great Aaron Sorkin is what I call very good as always Thee movie also has great supporting work from the new Spider Man actor Andrew Garfield and current music success Justin Timberlake This is the best movie that tells the story of the newest computer billionaire since Bill Gates who is currently the richest man in the world,10

15 October 2010,No Facebook in Facebook movie shock!,Laggards may scoff at this film about Facebook the current cultural phenomenon at the peak of its networking power but the tale of it s genesis from the dorm rooms of Harvard to the bedrooms of every man woman and child in the western world is as old as the carrier pigeon So old that screenwriter Aaron Sorkin has been at pains to point out that it s themes of betrayal jealousy and friendship could have been written by Shakespeare or Chayefsky This may sound like Sorkin starting to believe his own golden award enriched hype but there s an element of truth in his deserved self aggrandising Director David Fincher sometimes prone to brilliant and artistic flights of fancy in films such as Fight Club plays a steady hand here by letting Sorkin s quick fire script roll off the tongues of the leads and push the narrative with every sardonic quip and computer jargon soliloquy It really is a testament to the mutually beneficial partnership between director and screenwriter that when The Social Network moves it s attention from computer screen to litigation room via three separate testimonies and perspectives like a Ritalin starved 14 year old it is still able to hold your attention throughout Of course there are the odd Fincher touches and themes the exclusive frat party which is shot like one of Tyler Durden s wet dreams and his constant penchant for dark autumnal desk lamp lighting for example but really this is an Aaron Sorkin film with the auteur Fincher providing a beautifully lit blank screen for typing Facebook itself plays a relative backseat in proceedings Sorkin all too aware that placing the website front and centre would be as interesting as accepting Farmville invites every two minutes Instead the website s creator Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg is the focus of attention His inability to be included in the hierarchy of the American higher education system be that via the exclusive rowing clubs or romantically with female classmates the catalyst for the ironic creation of this all inclusive behemoth Eisenberg s portrayal of Zuckerberg as a computer genius outsider with borderline Asbergers is engagingly restrained neurotic and amusing in equal measure Each million he makes and each friend request he accepts taking him further away from any semblance of real life and real friends There are also stand out performances from Andrew Garfield as the frustrated friend exacerbated admirer and co worker Eduardo Saverin and Justin Timberlake as Napster creator Sean Parker Timberlake especially enjoying the opportunity to stand on the shoulders of Zuckerberg s genius with Iago like arsehole zeal and cowardice The Social Network is an almost perfect film that packages the early 21st century version of the American Dream in a simple and engaging morality tale Zuckerberg s rise from dorm room Bill Gates to owner of a 25 billion company playing like an out of control monster movie It s Alive Read more of my reviews at www sonofkermode blogspot com,9
6 July 2019,One of the most interesting character dramas made,The Social Network was never a film on my radar but upon hearing that David Fincher directed it and Aaron Sorkin wrote it I had to go check this film out I have no regrets The Social Network is definitely one of the most engaging dramas I ve had the pleasure of watching Everything was pretty much bang on Fincher s direction was immaculate Every scene was clear and had a great style to it What really stood out to me was Sorkin s script I knew Sorkin was one of the best scriptwriters working today but here I was just in awe at his work Each and every dialogue felt captivating and added a lot of personality to everyone s character especially Mark Zuckerberg The cinematography was top notch and the music throughout felt very fitting to whatever was going on in the scene Jesse Eisenberg owned the role of Zuckerberg He delivered his lines so well and proved to me that he is capable of handling a serious role Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake were also perfect in their roles and gave their best performances Even if the film is factually inaccurate at times the drama and conflict that takes place between the characters creates such an investing experience that you tend not to think about what aspects of the film are true or false I would highly recommend The Social Network On a technical level this movie is outstanding The direction by Fincher and screenplay from Sorkin provides us an engrossing insight into the troubles faced by Zuckerberg after the creation of Facebook This film has to be watched if you ve never seen it,10
7 December 2021,Eisenberg was Born for this Role,I liked Jesse Eisenberg in Zombieland I liked him in Now You See Me I loved him in The Social Network He was born for the role Jesse played Mark Zuckerberg in a movie about the tumultuous creation of Facebook He was a wordy snarky brilliant son of a gun who had the social skills of a moody Rainman which makes it quite funny that he would be a pioneer in social networking The movie bounces back and forth between his creation of Facebook and his two different arbitrations He was on the defendant end of arbitration with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss played by Armie Hammer and Josh Pence as well as with his former best friend and co founder Eduardo Saverin played by Andrew Garfield What should ve been or could ve been a lovely windfall of cash and fame for two guys ended up being a bitter fight And we all know who the winner was What s so amazing to me about this movie is that I loved it in spite of the fact I intensely dislike social media Like I mentioned Jesse Eisenberg was stellar but so was everyone else Andrew Garfield Armie Hammer Josh Pence Max Minghella as Divya Narendra and even Justin Timberlake as the arrogant partying playboy Napster creator Sean Parker The performances across the board were astounding which truly brought the script to life I never have and never will have a Facebook account or Twitter or Instagram or TikTok or whatever is the flavor of the hour I m not going to insult those who do have such accounts they re just not for me At the same time I don t live in a cave so I know what these services are and how popular they are It does interest me how certain people and businesses become famous or infamous and The Social Network is an excellent movie on how one of the wealthiest companies in the world came into being,9
17 November 2010,Seems Like Most People Are More Interested in Using Facebook Than Seeing Movies About It,Though I think The Social Network is a blisteringly good film I can see why it seems to have landed with a thud with audiences I m fascinated by David Fincher s filmmaking when he s at his best this film Zodiac but it wouldn t surprise me to find that others think his style is cold and clinical He s obsessed with facts and details and though The Social Network doesn t stint on things like characterizations and thematic richness it s just as full of tiny details about computer code business deals and legalese Jesse Eisenberg is perfectly cast as Mark Zuckerberg at least as Zuckerberg is portrayed in this film Eisenberg is an inherently unlikable actor in that condescending way common to pompous techies and bookish intellectuals He s surrounded by a terrific cast most notably Andrew Garfield who plays his best friend and business partner and who later becomes one of his chief enemies when the beast that is Facebook is unleashed on the world Fincher is a pro at building mood and atmosphere I can t think of a more atmospheric film than Zodiac and most of The Social Network is infused with a sense of impending doom that would feel incongruous in the context of something as trivial as social networking if social networking had not become a force so strong as to change the entire profile pun intended of our culture Grade A,9
4 November 2019,"It's a good movie, not absolutely great like most people say",I thought the movie was quite decent not absolutely amazing like most of the people and nearly all the critics say which is quite surprising The plot was good and kept me intrigued even though some parts of the movie I found hard understand I felt the drama in the movie was good I didn t know about the events that were portrayed in the movie but it made me dislike Mark Zuckerberg a little bit because I felt sorry and sympathetic to Eduardo I m surprised the critics have rated this movie very highly for me yeah it s a good movie but not up there with one of the greatest movies I ve seen,7
3 October 2010,Extremely entertaining,This one had a lot of things going against it at least for me First I generally don t like David Fincher with the one exception of Zodiac Second I also don t like Aaron Sorkin I m not extremely familiar with his work but I used to watch his show Sports Night and it s pretty freaking difficult to forgive him for that pile of crap Third I could not care less about Facebook It just seems incredibly unnecessary I don t like people I barely know or haven t known in a long while having any knowledge of my current comings and goings and heck IMDb takes up so much time of my life why would I really want another bit of the internet biting off chunks of my life Of course this movie is solely about the founding of Facebook and really does little or nothing with the way Facebook has affected the concept of friendship in the 21st Century although honestly that sounds like an interesting film itself but I probably wouldn t watch it because it would make me feel so out of the loop And it is a fairly interesting story As for Fincher that one exception of Zodiac is the reason I will probably see anything he makes in the future some may wait for video however Plus this one seemed like it would be tapping into Fincher s Zodiac talent what with its being a complex true story His talent is in his attention to details and it serves him well here Sorkin is a little harder to get over and during the opening sequence in which Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg has a quick witted conversation argument with his date Rooney Mara I was very afraid that I was going to be beat down by his overly clever dialogue Fortunately that scene is the worst in the movie and while occasionally the dialogue feels overwrought generally it s smart without showing off So with all of the challenges conquered how did it fare for me Very well in fact It s far from the greatest film ever made which is what the insane buzz was saying beforehand but it s very entertaining Really the story shouldn t be anywhere near as entertaining as the film turns out to be When I went over it again in my head it felt fairly shallow But it rushes along with such energy that it swept me along with it like an ocean wave Fincher does a great job and he s helped exponentially by the editing Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall and the score Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross I really want the score to win the Oscar if for no other reason than to give Trent Reznor an Oscar My 17 year old self would be ecstatic at that proposition The cast is also excellent I think they work best as an ensemble but yes Eisenberg is wonderful Andrew Garfield shows off his star potential in his biggest role yet and Justin Timberlake is amazing as the guy who created Napster It may not be a masterpiece but it s definitely one of the best films of 2010,8
22 August 2018,Fincher at his best,The Social Network had high expectations apart from the fascinating subject which will be of immediate interests to driven millennials the film was being helmed by David Fincher and penned by Aaron Sorkin The film justifies the expectation and all the credit goes to the men stated above The Social Network is about friendship and jealousy intertwined with creativity and flashes of collaborative brilliance among a bunch of highly motivated young men How much the film is close to the actual truth should be irrelevant as the screenplay itself is based on a book But the resultant book is compatible for big screen fodder The screenplay is as expected from Sorkin full of witty banter and cool exchanges Fincher s direction is crisp and the pacing is incredible Cinematography is suitable for the subject location and Fincher never overdoes anything Of course this is riveting drama because of the actors many of who have become well established today and they are all exceptional,
2 October 2010,"Once we built things, now we build websites.",I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,9
5 August 2018,Overall A Good Movie,Watching The Social Network after the film came out 8 years ago and after Facebook launched 15 years ago helped me to better review the social media storm in our lives How it all began was much more humane than it looks today Film portrays the college life Harvard label critic and entrepreneurism process well I praise Jesse Eisenberg s acting as he was able to convince me how smart Zuckerberg can be in real life,8
25 February 2013,Too trivial and irritating for me,I think that a background score is meant to enhance the movie A good background score never steals attention from the movie but complements it So judging by that I think the soundtrack for this movie was one of the worst I ever heard And of course they gave the movie an Oscar for it maybe because it was so revolutionary and broke all the norms The movie itself was so trivial and so close to real life to get any enjoyment out of Dialog was grating on my nerves and reminded me of some of the real life obnoxious guys I know People who enjoy an argument just for sake of an argument When I started watching the movie the first couple of minutes were good the dialog was real but it got old real fast Its all too petty and everybody is griping about something,2
23 November 2010,Just a great story of something we now take for granted,I give this film 10 out of 10 I m not sure how much is truth and how much is fiction but what I will say is I enjoyed it from start to end The filming script story and acting are of the best quality It s just a complete eye opener as to how facebook was born and the problems and success it created for all those involved Whats great is the story is based around something that has become such a household name and that it s something we can relate to without knowing much about where it came from how and why Loved it,10
5 February 2011,Is it really a movie?,THe first thing I should do is declare an interest or maybe it d be more accurate to say a LACK of it I didn t come to this film with a particularly open mind I actively dislike Facebook and the whole social networking phenomenon so if a drama about its origins was to keep me on board for the whole ride it would have an uphill battle on its hands Sure enough by about 20 minutes in I was getting restless Simon Amstell sorry Jesse Eisenberg does a great job as Zuckerberg but the script portrays him as such a thoroughly unlikeable asocial being that I found it pretty hard to give a damn about what he was doing and his fellow Harvard undergrads were portrayed as a pretty vacuous bunch of twerps too which didn t help Fortunately the character of co founder Eduardo Saverin provided somebody to care about Then before my hand had strayed too close to my coat the plot began to thicken nicely and thereafter the pacing kept us bowling along to the finish line Was it worth sticking with it to the end On the whole yes it s a fairly satisfying drama However I m not sure that it really qualifies as a movie A tale well told it may be but to me it felt more like it belonged on the small screen as a two part TV drama perhaps not as something you d willingly part with hard cash to go and see in a cinema Oh and one final thing can somebody PLEASE tell David Fincher that incredibly dingy yellow lit interiors aren t atmospheric they re just very difficult to see,5
14 September 2020,The Facebook Movie,This film is incredible David Fincher utilized amazing filmmaking to his advantage and crafted one of the best films I ve ever seen,10
15 November 2010,"Boring, boring, boring and stupid",Simply boring I can understand FB lovers can like this movie but there is nothing in it It jumps back and forth form the story to the lawsuit of a bunch of immature kids getting rich without any understanding of business in facts the book title is The Accidental Billionaires And the movie is accidentally overrated The storyline is poor and the story too recent to be history Girls are depicted as merely stupid sluts The idea the this movie gives of the US is that there any kid drunk punk with no substantial culture can become a billionaire Nice picture Besides the good acting of Jesse Eisenberg and of Andrew Garfield the direction of David Fincher is poor maybe because the story itself is poor Do not waste your time watching this movie Stay at home and read a good book,3
23 October 2010,My Masturbation Over a Trailer,When I first saw the trailer I couldn t believe it Who could make such a beautiful trailer It was oozing with sexuality social anxieties and jinxy little characters I was enthralled That commercial with THAT music it was just so heavenly like It moved me It spoke to me I just had to see this So I went And I couldn t believe it I was watching a movie about Facebook Forty minutes into the movie I was unable to keep my face from drooping my muscles were laxed as was my brain I was turning into a zombie but the cure was just over my shoulder it was right behind me THE DOOR GET TO THE EXIT SAVE YOURSELF Hello My name is paperpag And I am a survivor I left the theater,5
16 October 2010,Dramatic,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,9
28 September 2010,Timely and Timeless,I ve been digesting The Social Network for a few days now and I m still not sure I m ready to offer up my thoughts on it It s rare for a film to make such an impact on me true Toy Story 3 tugged at my heartstrings while Inception raped my mind but The Social Network appeals to me on a different level Perhaps it s because of its relevance to our times like last year s Up in the Air Unlike that film though The Social Network is especially pertinent to me because Facebook is such a huge part of my life It s something that quite literally connects us all much like the shared experience of seeing a movie this is even more true in this case as the screening I attended was sold out a free screening for Ohio State students It s thrilling to think how each of us is a part of the story in some way We are among the hundreds of millions who made this site the success it is thus the controversy Thus the film David Fincher follows up his beautiful haunting Benjamin Button with something completely different Set in our times and on our computer screens the drama of The Social Network isn t confined to a fantastical take on the past Instead it s a thrilling look at our present Fincher directs a cast full of young fresh faces through performances that show their potential and hint at their future success He keeps the film moving at a perfect pace building an appropriate momentum that matches the intense success story that is Facebook The structure is gorgeous too When the film first cuts to one hearing then the other as the film s tagline says Zuckerberg makes a few enemies you ll likely feel lost There s no way to ground yourself in the images you re absorbing the film just throws you in This brilliant bit of editing portends the morally questionable path Zuckerberg heads down while also reflecting the very nature of Facebook Just as you re unsure what exactly is happening in these first glimpses of the legal proceedings so are Zuckerberg and company unsure of what Facebook is going to become Numerous times throughout the film characters admit to not knowing what it is It s huge epic in a way that few things are It spans the globe while being limited to screens It s something profoundly modern but handled with the film making mastery of cinema s finest auteurs Perhaps the highlight of the film is Aaron Sorkin s phenomenal screenplay The dialogue flies fast and sharp ably including the techno babble but tempering it with humor and enough layman s terms to keep the audience in the loop The inclusion of multiple points of view lends the film a sense of fairness and accuracy Of course you expect that there s exaggeration for the sake of being more cinematic dramatic or entertaining but the extensive attention paid to each character makes the story easier to believe than other films based on true stories Sorkin s words sound perfectly acidic and natural coming out of Jesse Eisenberg Eisenberg deserves awards attention for his performance as Zuckerberg this is the role that will hopefully catapult him to the star status he so deserves and has received in moderation after great turns in Adventureland and Zombieland Andrew Garfield continues to impress as cofounder Eduardo Saverin he now has three fantastic turns under his belt for the year with Never Let Me Go yet to come in my neck of the woods at least Justin Timberlake s involvement in the film likely gave some film aficionados pause but he s a natural fit for Napster founder Sean Parker He exudes confidence energy and just the right amount of sleaziness Also worth noting is Rooney Mara who has a small role but does big things with it and will get her chance to shine under Fincher s direction again as Lisbeth Salander in the American take on The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo At two hours The Social Network is a long movie but it never feels like it The film possesses an elegance of design not unlike that of the website it revolves around Every aspect of the film is handled just so from the gorgeous cinematography to the great cast from the fitting editing to the unforgettable writing The Social Network is perhaps the film of the year It s timely and timeless a combination that few films can ever hope to achieve,10
21 September 2021,Sickening,Do not bother Do not bother Do not bother Do not bother,1
10 March 2014,Shocking...,I m not a movie expert but I know a bad film when I see one Me and a friend decided we would go and see it in the cinema and eventually we left even having paid an unworthy amount to see it I was struggling to keep my eyes open Even though it was deftly made and it had a good storyline based on a true story and interesting for those who like that sort of thing there was some mediocre acting And the score even though it was different in my opinion it did not deserve the Oscar compared to some of the scores nominated that year Albeit very interesting I thought it was somehow repetitive and slightly boring Personally I cannot see how in the world this film has been so critically well claimed when masterpieces such as the Shawshank Redemption have scores as low as 50 on Metacritic whilst this has no less than 95 I feel it was boring slow paced and at the most average,1
17 August 2019,Style and substance balanced well,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,10
13 October 2016,A Movie That Appeals To Every Generation,When you first hear that a movie is going to be made about the creation of Facebook you don t think big things from it much less that it would be consider one of this generations masterpieces Thought I wouldn t go as far as that I still love The Social Network and I think that it s a close second for David Finchers best film After seeing this film I legitimately could not have seen someone else directing this film he just knows how to direct a movie his process of taking as many as takes as necessary works for this movie as it mirrors the themes of inventiveness and betrayal This is arguably Jesse Eisenberg most icon role and it is for a reason he s just perfect in this movie his acting style matches perfectly with the character of Mark Zuckerberg who is a fascinating protagonist Even though he isn t always the most likable character his say things as they are attitude makes him an intriguing and sometimes funny character that always captures the viewers attention Most of the events of this film are shown through flashbacks and while that has been seen before it works perfectly for this films narrative and makes for some truly amazing editing Aaron Sorkins screenplay is one of the best written of recent years it s a script that in some way relates to everyone we ve all had something that we re good at in life and want to strive to be the best at we ve all had friends that we want to keep but can t because real life gets in the way all of this is addressed in The Social Networking making sure that everyone will in some way be able to connect with this film The supporting cast are all fantastic in this film Andrew Garfield was worthy of at least an Oscar nomination in this film he bounces perfectly of Eisenberg and serves a reflection of the audience in this film Justin Timberlake also really blew me away in this film he just is so good at playing his almost unlikable character and has never since been able to live up to this performance Overall The Social Network is a guaranteed classic that will forever be remembered by this generation as one of its most relatable movies and one of Finchers best efforts 100 A,10
3 October 2010,An amazing piece of work!,Fincher is a true original and must have a lot of power in all areas of the film process because as usual he avoided making a Hollywood Movie And since it wasn t a hackneyed movie that we ve seen so many times before he made it very interesting with the help of music sound design manic conversations wonderful photography The acting is all superb I am still amazed how multi talented Justin Timberlake is Jesse Eisenberg stole the show He played a cold nerdy brilliant workaholic with nothing else on his mind He created a character who was easily annoyed by improper questions and anything mundane Thank God there was no happy ending with all sides doing a group hug This is a fascinating film with tons of facts and evidence that of which I had been grossly unaware Highly recommend,9

4 October 2010,What's entertaining about watching people you don't like,This moving bored me to death I think the main character was so unlikable that paying to watch him be an hole for 90 minutes was a big waste of money The characters were cartoons rather than real people When I see a movie I like the main character to have at least a thread of redeeming value This one had none In fact I have more disdain for Facebook now than ever A person like that doesn t care how he uses the 500 million people of Facebook I feel violated that I let a person like the main character have access to any of my personal information on Facebook The acting was OK but nothing great Some of it was just plain poor Maybe I am just too old to understand what is good and what is bad to the X generation and younger I think GOD for that Don t bother with this movie,2
3 September 2020,The greatest documentary of all time,This is the best documentary ever made It is almost all fact and it uses this to its advantage It s dark It s gritty It s sad It s funny Probably the best movie of the last 20 years Please watch it,10
12 June 2023,A Competent Drama which explores the events leading to the rise of social networking giant.,A Competent Drama which explores the events leading to the rise of social networking giant My Rating 65 100 The Social Network is a biographical drama which highlights the trials and tribulations faced by Mark Zuckerberg while he embarks on the journey to make Facebook big How the conflicts between the three founders including Eduardo Saverin and Sean Parker lead to the multiple trails and leads to Mark paying up for the mess they were into This David Fincher directorial tries to establish the story from Eduardo s POV and keeps you fairly engaged with its dump of information in a fast paced manner Wonder if the creative liberty of Fincher made Jesse Eisenberg speak so damn fast or that Mark usually used to speak like that The performanaces are noteworthy Baring the fast paced dialogur deliveries of Jesse Eisenberg he is likeable and does put in the sarcasm nicely Andrew Garfield as Eduardo is my favourite He literally kills it with a dominating final act Justin Timberlake is good too Overall the social network is a fairly decent true story which talks about the trials faced by Mark rather than highlighting thr challenges he faced to invent facebook Instagram Twitter streamgenx,6
20 June 2019,Jesse Eisenberg is smart,I love a good biographical movie and this is not too shabby Jesse Eisenberg does a wonderful portrayal of an anti social super nerd by the name of Mark Zuckerberg One thing I will say is that this movie is much more educational than I would expect in regards to the history of Facebook It is entertaining to see how the characters progress in the movie It is a pretty standard film that I won t necessarily recommend watching but also definitely not complaining about seeing in the first place Not too memorable overall,8

23 February 2023,Interesting story,The social network movie was definitely much better than the Steve Jobs movie which bored me pretty much I did watch the movie cause I wanted to know a bit about how facebook was created and how everything started I liked the movie even if I am not a big Jesse Eisenberg fan The story was told in a very interesting way and I liked how it showed the interactions between the different characters Kudos to Andrew Garfield this was some incredible performance I know that the movie is probably not 100 accurate cause it is a movie but if Mark Zuckerbergs personality is really like they represented in the movie then his is not a nice person you want to hang or be around with he comes off as very arrogant a know it all who doesn t care about what happens to other people around him,7
13 August 2022,"great casting, but too over hyped",Yes I get that this film won awards and that people hold it in high regard First thing is that the casting is great Eisenberg plays zuckerberg well and I really don t think anyone else could pull it off Garfield and timberlake did good always and I enjoy seeing rashida jones in things The characters were good and I felt the cast played them well I d say the dialog however was a little half baked in places and the scenes depicting the hearing were not the best Apart from that though still an enjoyable film with good acting and directing But not as great as everyone makes out,6
4 November 2010,Non-stop fast talking,The Social Network is a movie where the character never shut up throughout the movie But there is nothing wrong with that The story is non fiction but the script is mostly fiction It was dramatized So it s not very dramatic in real life when Zuckerberg created FaceBook The movie has a lot of dialog and that is not a flaw The dialog is too deep and the tempo of the dialog is too fast It s not very easy to understand but it was overwhelming amazing The acting was great Jesse Eisenberg is always a great actor Andrew Garfield s performance makes me wanna watch the reboot of Spiderman which I was suppose to boycott Justin Timberlake s acting was unexpected It s his best performance so far The Social Network tells the true story of Facebook but the best thing about this movie is the dialog acting directing I have nothing else to say but this movie is one of the best movies of the year,10
21 July 2013,Says it all,When the main character in a film is a egotistical sociopath with no redeeming qualities what is the point The good guy plays second fiddle and gets screwed while all around him are a bunch of clueless kids trying to get one over on each other What this movie is good for is showing how ridiculous dotcoms and the people behind them are Whilst I try to avoid all advertising on Facebook it still makes me mad to know some moron is making money out of my profile Meanwhile good guys like Bill Gates get hammered for making too much money even though he gives most of it away Maybe one day people will wake up and see how pathetic it is to live their lives in a virtual world but until then we have to accept that despicable MZ types are the new kings of industry even though they make nothing tangible or useful They hold an incredible power over a new generation of gullibles The film is not terrible and the acting is generally good but as a story it is flawed by a weak script and almost entirely populated with unlikeable characters As a piece of social history and commentary on where the world is at however it becomes relevant and almost necessary viewing,3
28 December 2020,Trys To Hard To Be Edgy,The fast dialog and pompous characters gets old fast Story line is weak Revolvers around annoying college students that are just recycled characters from some high school party movie Not worth watching,3
1 October 2010,"A original movie, cold, but quite fascinating and captivating",The Social Network is a good film to contradict a frequent argument that cinema is running out of Ideas History is always in the making so there are always new stories to tell The question is not so much which stories are worth telling but how they are told This one is worth telling and told well enough to earn its place as one of the best films of the year FACEBOOK is among the greatest cultural innovations of the free world so far this century and even with 500 million users I m not even sure the site is in its prime yet It has yet to be legalized in China Ironically the simple fact that FACEBOOK is young is the movie s only problem from a film point of view David Fincher is telling a story that feels incomplete Imagine if Citizen Kane ended with Charles Foster becoming the king of American Newspaper It would be an epic build up but there would still be much to tell That s sort of the way it feels with The Social Network The ending is rushed but then again what else was there to do wait eighty years for Mark Zuckerberg to die and make the movie then encompassing his whole life The Social Network is about how Zuckerberg came to power When the film ends he has a little over a million users It is a short time span to work with but it is to the great credit of David Fincher and writer Aaron Sorkin that this motion picture is without a dull moment This is a rapid fire motion picture is one clever line after another and some are pretty funny Jesse Eisenberg gives a fiery performance aided in part by his dialogue and I also got a kick out of one sequence with involves a kayak race directed in music video fashion which is where David Fincher has his roots I can definitely see the Social Network finding its way to the Academy awards It will certainly be a proud moment for David Fincher who with each movie seems to be getting a larger voice,8

31 December 2013,One of Fincher's Worst- It's just stupid,Maybe not understanding all the programming and math involved in the technical side of the project makes me feel like an idiot I have no idea what any of equations or algorithms mean or how to write script Maybe I m a little jealous because I never got to go to college parties as glamorous as the ones in this film Or maybe the problem is that the subject matter it just so banal that despite the quality of the production this film is lost on me I have a problem with this film that is so full of maybes And yet for all its weaknesses it won three Oscars albeit one of them was for Baxter and Wall s editing which is superb Both editors have worked on numerous Fincher productions None of the actors are convincing at portraying the real people they are supposed represent Maybe that s the point They are attempting to play versions of Zuckerberg and Co that seem more interesting than the real live versions I guess I see the reasoning behind this As activities creating companies programming computers or writing software no matter how profound aren t exactly as riveting as invading Bin Laden s compound or smuggling blood diamonds out of Liberia Still I am no fan of Jesse Eisenberg His success is baffling to me He was for a while a Michael Cera impersonation gone wrong now whatever he is he does it well He sells tons of tickets but none of them are to me The best part about this film is that it has Rooney Mara briefly Later she becomes Lisbeth in Dragon Tattoo The most interesting thing about this film is simply that it exists and was so successful Rather that a production company actually paid David Fincher to try and create a full on thriller packed with betraying greedy snarky little boys either getting their way or losing millions of dollars Poor babies Even if in the end Zuckerberg did create something monumental so what It s just a monument to a monument What does any of this represent How does any of this change the world It s not like Facebook has cured any sick people or stopped any wars It s arguably even created a recent few of both Getthebonesaw blogspot com,5

3 January 2011,The Facebook story,This guy is one of the much loved American film nerds But he isn t much lovable Quite arrogant too clever and an absolute lousy dater He s much more successful in front of the computer So he creates Facebook and heads big business Not with a little help from his friends on the contrary but with big help from this Napster guy There s one problem here They talk far too much and sometimes you almost have the feeling that you re listening to radio theatre If it wasn t for this screen Good handicraft about a very present story but not really filmish,7
28 October 2015,Disappointing,I m not sure just what I was expecting but it wasn t this The DVD cost 5 for a two disc set I watched disc 1 last year rated it a 2 and wrote in my journal can t be bothered to see the bonus features Is that fair So now I ve seen disc two and rated that a 2 also and wrote the only so far review then disc one again and then again to get the director s commentary OK the acting is good Eisenberg looks and sounds like Zuckerberg But Zuckerberg is portrayed as clever ruthless manipulating unscrupulous devious unpleasant dishonest disloyal and yet he hasn t sued So is it accurate That is not my impression of Mark from all sources not personal of course Time magazine s Person of the Year for 2010 was Zuckerberg and they were writing the story as the movie was released and it is mentioned a couple of times in what is otherwise a real hagiography Zuckerberg s only comment is to question their representation for the motivation for the whole idea of Facebook But the article doesn t mention the names Winklevoss or Saverin once Not really a surprise Here is my advice Watch the first scene which took 99 takes to get but be warned you will have to turn the subtitles on otherwise you ll miss half what is babbled This must be the worst ever first scene of a movie Then go to Scene Selection and go to 15 the second to last by then Facebook is flying and they go past the 1 million members it is a huge success But then we learn that the lawsuit that has occupied most of the scenes from 2 14 is to be settled out of court and it involves the payment by Zuckerberg or Facebook of a HUGE sum and another the details of which remain a secret but is even HUGER There are times when I was really impressed by the production and there are some good little scenes but overall it leaves a bad memory and nearly all lawsuit films are boring,2
23 October 2010,A Nutshell Review: The Social Network,Who would have guessed that the next big thing that took the Internet and the real world by storm would be the application that crafts our social network digitally for the online world to see There s hardly a time I encounter anyone without a Facebook page or are not actively updating it unless of course you re stuck in a country that has barred access to it It s a simple but brilliant idea translated which made the founders billions of dollars and propelling them into the elite club of the superrich and David Fincher s The Social Network maps a dramatization of how the world s social network got created from the dorm rooms in Harvard University Based on the book by Ben Mezrich Aaron Sorkin s screenplay doesn t bog us down with a mountain of details choosing instead to focus on the sexier parts which kept the narrative moving at breakneck speed beginning with the introduction of the socially inept Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg on a disastrous date the irony of course that he ll be chief architect and co founder of a social networking site before heading back to his dorm room in a fit of anger and creating a site that melts the university s network while drunk and gaining notoriety overnight With the writing on the wall Fincher paces this film with such velocity that you ll hardly ever realize that two hours had passed when we reach the obligatory closure titles that pepper a biography As with almost every biographical film it comes with a tinge of drama to spice things up so it s obviously not wise to take this film like the bible word for word but it does provide an excellent study into the nature of human friendships and business relationships and how the two often come dangerously close to a collision that will make friends and or partners fall out of favour with one another especially since it is fairly easy to surmise that everyone has an opinion of how a company should be run in a post dot com bubble burst whether risks are to be taken in a giant leap of faith or to go down the more traditional route of monetizing a site through ad revenue Fincher adopts a non linear narrative for The Social Network and you ll be forgiven if you find yourself a little bit disorientated in the beginning since he throws you into the middle of not one but two lawsuits one between Mark Zuckerberg and the Winklevoss brothers Cameron and Tyler both played by Armie Hammer who are adamant that the technology whizz had stolen their idea when they pitched it to him in the confines of their exclusive club while the other is between once best friends and roommates Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield the new Peter Parker Spiderman in a relationship and friendship that had gone sour and communications between the two conducted with lawyers as intermediaries But you ll find your balance soon enough as both narrative threads are equally compelling and engaging to sit through and you ll begin to see the plenty of issues and challenges that always automatically come along when something or someone becomes successful otherwise who would bother at all As if that is not engaging enough the introduction of Napster founder Sean Parker Justin Timberlake spices things a lot more as he seduces Mark easily since they talk on a technological level leaving Eduardo a lot more cautious because of Sean s shady background with drugs and his womanizing ways But of course if someone brings funding and expertise and know how for having been there and done that as well as experience in navigating the tough business waters then perhaps Sean s deemed as the necessary evil to bring Facebook forward having to contribute to workable iconic ideas even off the cuff While Jesse Eisenberg is spot on in his portrayal of a highly intelligent geek with a problematic EQ and as someone who doesn t mince his words and Andrew Garfield being quite suave as the business economics undergraduate who cannot believe their collective success that skyrockets their popularity and a groupie following it is Justin Timberlake who would have thought as the relatively sleazy Sean Parker who steals the show with his anecdotes having some of the best lines in the show and being the quasi villain that the story lacked in the driving of a wedge between two best friends in the dogged quest to have something to do with what he sees as potentially the next big thing in the world As he will attest to great ideas somehow have their connections stem back from the female of the species and here there s no lack of that reference and truly the film comes alive with the Mark Eduardo Sean axis of characters coming together that has trust issues business and personal friendships all put on the line One thing about David Fincher s filmography thus far is his aptitude to tell stories that are dark in nature epic and biographical The Social Network has all these rolled into one with a story about one of the world s most popular website and the ugliness of how a business relationship can sour genuine friendship into nothing more than a bitter aftertaste It doesn t pass judgement on its characters but allows you to form your own conclusions Definitely one of the best and engaging films of the year perhaps also because it s something easy to identify with and based upon a pop cultural tool that s still I believe yet to achieve its peak A must watch,10
9 June 2014,"""The New Socialism""",Have you ever wondered what a collaboration between all your favourite creative people would look and sound like To be honest I had not it s such an improbable event the chances of such a thing happening are so remote that it s not even worth thinking about Roll VT I am sitting in the superb Grosvenor Cinema in Glasgow s West End about to enjoy the latest offering from David Fincher The Social Network I know that it is scripted by Aaron Sorkin he of West Wing fame either one is a strong recommendation on its own but both together bodes very well indeed I am anticipating eagerly Trigger Street Productions ah an unexpected bonus my favourite actor of the 90 s and probably the other decades too Kevin Spacey Glengarry Glen Ross 92 Swimming With Sharks 94 Se7en 95 Usual Suspects 95 LA Confidential 97 American Beauty 99 an incomparable body of work in such a short period has produced truly a stamp of quality Even now a full house has not even entered my head and then the opening bars of the soundtrack creep from the speakers as the camera tracks up the stairs only the first handful of notes are required it s only Trent flaming Reznor who s written the soundtrack prophet of an alternative generation and my touchstone for musical inspiration Right from the opening lines you have to run to keep up Sorkin s dialogue is as snappy and intelligent as the West Wing or Studio 60 ever were it s nasty smug angry when it needs to be but always always very very clever Who do you pick to write a script about a computer genius A scriptwriting genius of course The central performances are all good Jesse Eisenberg in particular as the anti hero Zuckerberg excellently portrays a detached and somewhat bemused persona that I would imagine most computer geniuses have while Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake provide excellent foils for our hero s single minded petulance The protagonists all have their faults and none of the characters elicited any sympathy in me That s usually a cue to switch off but The Social Network transcends the characters and the plot which is largely irrelevant in the sense that we all know how the story ends to this point at least But the script holds everything together and I found it impossible to take my eyes off the screen On paper this is a turkey a movie about an Internet billionaire and the contractual and legal fog that surrounded his success It could not be a better example of what true genius can deliver to the screen As a child like most children I used to think that the actors did all the work and I wondered who all the other people in the credits were if ever there was a lesson in how naive that childish view is it in the team that brought us The Social Network,10
11 October 2010,Text-speak as high drama,If the idea of the creation of a social networking site for college students yielding the world s youngest billionaire feels surreal then the notion of a box office smash hit about a young man creating a website should prove even more indicative of the disorientation of the self appointed age of media Nonetheless David Fincher s The Social Network is happy to hit the ground running apparently thinking of itself as a current day All the President s Men or as Fincher calls it the Citizen Kane of John Hughes movies through being a suspenseful youth oriented movie providing a commentary on its time That the film s overall tone is far more snappy cynical and noncommittal is as telling of the times a changin as it is poignantly hard to tell whether Fincher s film fails to make any grander statements about its era or youth culture or ironically through skirting the issue it perfectly represents them However first and foremost The Social Network functions as both drama and character study detailing the now infamous story of 19 year old Mark Zuckerberg s spark of internet genius spiralling into a series of heated dramatic confrontations lawsuits explosions of stock and cementing a place in the cultural lexicon unlike any other now known as the website company landmark Facebook It is important to keep in mind that the film while rooted in fact is an unabashedly embellished and fictionalized telling predicated more on dramatic effect than factual realism with some of the points of the story reeking more of obvious artifice than others particularly the tragically ironic ending However if nothing else there is no doubt that Fincher and screen writing Aaron Sorkin have created one of the more exciting films of college students speaking fervently over computers to hit cinemas in ages as Sorkin s slickly polished script allows each line to crackle with the visceral immediacy of a fistfight In fact the film functions so well as an impeccably oiled machine that it largely vetoes its own concerns about bias within the story whether or not Zuckerberg is to blame for allegedly stealing the idea of Facebook from a commission from fellow Harvard students ruthlessly cutting his own best friend out of his company troubling preconceptions of private and public spaces and so forth treating everything characterization included as if subjective circumstantial evidence at a trial up for individual interpretation and reprocessing Sorkin leaves it nearly impossible to root for anyone or anything in particular as the narrative feels locked into a consistent feeling of wheels inextricably in motion beyond all notions of emotional investment and simply intended to be appraised and marvelled at One could raise the concern of the film being too emotionally closed and distant particularly ironic for a film about a social network predicated on bringing people together were it not for the envisioned rebuttal as if delivered in a rapid fire acerbic monotone by Jesse Eisenberg that it simply has bigger fish to fry than satisfying trite conventional emotional expectations This is a film with a story to tell and a message about its times to convey albeit in a somewhat muddled fashion and like a good piece of software it refuses to compromise or slow down in the midst of accomplishing its core objectives Even Fincher s visual aesthetic captures this sense of sleek efficiency his crisp clean cinematography drinking in a depiction of Harvard neither excessively romanticized or banking on stereotypes Channeling the driven anxiety of his antihero protagonist Fincher shoots conversations and programming sessions like nail biting stakeouts and college parties as if alienating action sequences keeping the pace brisk and the tone ominous throughout If nothing else it is refreshing to see a film set at a college which doesn t come across like a beer commercial montage although it is clear which beer brand gave Fincher the most funding thankfully concentrating more on the story and characterizations as self contained rather than wallowing in attempting to deliver another banal treatise on this is what the point of college really is As characterizations go it would be difficult to ask for a more grimly memorable one than Jesse Eisenberg s undeniably artistic licence fuelled take on Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg Muting his natural neurotic charisma through a steely deadpan and constant unmoving half frown Eisenberg proves scarily good not only at inhabiting the piercing controlled mania of Zuckerberg but also turning him into an oddly sympathetic Machiavellian antihero just as easy to respect and even like as to despise it is easy to picture business majors worldwide taking notes In contrast Andrew Garfield brings a far more familiar emotional centre to the film as Zuckerberg s eventually jilted friend and business partner Eduardo Saverin With a casual likable aura and welcome strains of humour one of the best scenes of the film is Saverin s agonized confession at not knowing how to change his own Facebook relationship status Garfield makes Saverin s fade out from the Facebook all the more upsetting providing intriguing counterpoint to Zuckerberg s snappy success Finally in a gleefully self reflexive piece of casting Justin Timberlake oozes glamour and sleaze as the manipulative creator of free music downloading site Napster not chewing scenery so much as salivating upon it and providing a deliciously detestable face to corporate ambition While it may or may not have as much to say about the presence of technology in contemporary social relations the blurring of the spheres of private and public and the tension between individual or collective success as it may or may not mean to The Social Network provides an impressively assembled slice of fun and profundity with all creative talents concerned functioning at the top of their games Even or perhaps especially for those few still to be drawn in by the seductive allure of Facebook Fincher s film still proves an intriguing and even exhilarating watch and one of the best films of its year Like 8 5 10,9
7 November 2010,Why?,The film itself is excellently filmed and acted but I wonder why did they have to choose this particular story For all I know not only was the idea Facebook not brilliant but the real surprise is why no one came up with something similar to it back in the mid 90s when the internet just started plus the software itself posed no challenge at all from the algorithmic or programming point of view In this respect the story behind Google or Napster would have been even more interesting If Fincher wanted to make a film about stupidity and its different forms and about the mediocrity and the moral desert his society lives in he succeeded If he wanted to make a movie about truly brilliant people doing truly innovative things however he should have chosen other base material Fincher should be aware of how his films are understood by mainstream critics and audiences and if this film was meant to be ironic then the irony is too thin to be understood by most people let alone make a point you just have to read the reviews at Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic to realize this,6
23 July 2020,Complexingly amazing,Spot on performances and incredible editing makes this movie feel like one huge scene And it succeeded at it,8
1 August 2011,Like,Perhaps I read too much into this but I thought the friendship between Zuckerberg and Saverin in The Social Network ran very much parallel to the friendship of Jedediah Leland and Charles Foster Kane in Citizen Kane The disillusionment that Leland faces in having to expose his friend Kane as a fraud insofar as a man abandoning his core principles in running a newspaper to become a power hungry politician is in line with what Saverin faces in watching Zuckerberg be taken in by interloper Sean Parker and Parker s influential ideas on how to expand Facebook Both films feature scenes where the best friends of the lead characters confront their friendship conflict while reflecting nostalgically on their declining importance Leland s saved declaration of principles from the hand of a younger Charles Foster Kane and Saverin during a moment of reflection with Zuckerberg discussing an algorithm written on a dorm room window pane Both films are classic tales of young entrepreneurs becoming wealthy powerful and influential albeit without any friends,9
17 October 2010,Film as Greedy and Irritating as Its Subjects; Eisenberg - Wow!,In Social Network Jesse Eisenberg blossoms into an Academy Award worthy actor His performance as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is by turns clammy cold vacant snarky and mean as it should be If this were a better film I d watch it again just to savor Eisenberg s performance Zuckerberg s Eisenberg s perfect foils Cameron and Tyler the Winklevoss twins are both played by Armie Hammer and his performance is also noteworthy The Winklevoss twins were Harvard students and Olympic athletes from old WASP money Actor Armie Hammer is himself from old money He plays the Winklevoss twins without irony just here I am tall gorgeous blond athletic brilliant rich a superman product of WASP breeding Given how the politically correct cultural elite of the US has demonized its WASP founders it s amazing that the twins are not portrayed as bad guys here They re not good guys they re just really lucky genetic freaks Aryan Gods They are also shown to value old fashioned concepts like honor in business That a nerdy super smart manipulative romantically unsuccessful Jewish kid Zuckerberg requires establishment WASP princes and ubermenschen like the Winklevosses to sponsor him and that the Jewish kid eventually manages through his triumphant sneakiness and cleverness and litigation to screw the WASP princes over is a timeworn tale treated many times before significantly in Lion Feuchtwanger s Jud Suss Given how many times storytellers have gone to this well given the explosive and indeed deadly stereotypes at play I wish that director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin had ventured anything probing or original here but they do not The Social Network is every bit like the subjects it treats The film is desperately needy and it works too hard The film is very loud Characters often exchange key dialogue in clubs with loud music in the background The dialogue features every few seconds a sarcastic retort Every scene shouts at the viewer SOME PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ARE MUCH SMARTER THAN YOU AND THEY ATTEND EXCLUSIVE PARTIES AND MAKE MONEY YOU CAN T EVEN DREAM OF And snort coke off hard bellied coeds and bungee jump into built in swimming pools and are serviced by crazed groupies in the stalls of men s rooms Then they betray each other and their lives are not always fully emotionally satisfying You know I got all that the first time the movie told me and I really didn t need it repeated over and over and over and over again The final scene of The Social Network is unbelievably cheap If anyone tells you he was moved by that final scene that person needs to get out more It s a blatant failed attempt at a rosebud scene I liked the film at first but it really doesn t have anything new to say that I didn t know before I went in and I was really eager for it to finish up What besides Dutch angles and noir cinematography separates a film like The Social Network from a masterpiece also about ambition its rewards and costs like Sweet Smell of Success or Citizen Kane I think those who made those classics managed distance between themselves and their subjects Orson Welles did not fall under Hearst s spell Fincher and Sorkin appear to be very much in thrall to the smarts power and money they want to skewer but never really do Look at this man He s much smarter than you He s much richer than you And pity him because his social life is not as good as yours They shout But then they don t give you any reason to care about this film except its zombie dedication to money and power The Social Network says nothing about the power of facebook or how it s changing society or even if it is Scenes exploring those questions would not be as cool as scenes of snorting coke off a blond teenager s belly or watching one rich man screw over another Finally there s a miracle story here that no one making the film is interested in pursuing but that shines through in spite of the film s lust for decadent wealth Mark Zuckerberg really is smarter than you or I That s a very wonderful thing It s also a wonderful thing that he managed to find his way to 21st century Harvard Had Zuckerberg been born in a mud hut in any number of locales and centuries his abundant gift at manipulating zeros and ones would have been wasted or even a curse That Zuckerberg s gift was allowed to flower in capitalist America is a much bigger story than the pettiness excess and spite the filmmakers insist on focusing on Zuckerberg s gift like Gates and Jobs etc will live on long after he and his cofounders and fellow travelers and everyone who envied these guys or wished them dead is forgotten,8
12 July 2017,"Very informative, tight screenplay and cast perfectly!",This one is a winner Many people don t know the rise of Facebook and although Mark Zuk has no affiliation with this film clearly the writers Aaron Sorkin screenplay and Ben Mezrich book did their research and came up with a tight screenplay David Fincher s directing could have not been better But the most memorable part of this film is Jesse Eisenberg s performance I don t think they could have cast anyone better to play Mark Zuk or for that matter anyone to play just that role of the Harvard nerd kid who made it Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake where also outstanding in their roles This is one of those films you can watch over and over and pick up something new each watch without getting bored I know I have Truly a winner and a perfect 10 10 from me,10
18 October 2010,The Social Vindication,First of all I don t have a Facebook account Second of all after watching the film I still don t have a Facebook account and I m not planning to have one That was as far as I could go for Facebook sakes but what really made me see the movie was its jaw dropping trailer and the relevance it accounts in today s connected world The film as a whole is superbly crafted The screenplay brought by the genius Aaron Sorkin is taut witty and spitfire like machine that requires people to fully invest their attention It takes the audience to a point where they can t help but ask What did he just say or say Now that s cool that s really cool The screenplay stands equally superb as the direction I ll just simply state that Fincher is Fincher when it comes to his direction and roving camera work But what really haunts me in this film is his signature lighting Unlike any other of his films in the past in here it flowed vividly unscathed It s always dark yet captivating to look at It has an effect perfectly blended through the immaculate score and story that in my opinion results in subtle resonance of every photographed scene On the side of acting I d like to give recognition to the casting director for it is a great job putting all the ensemble together From Eisenberg to Garfield to Timberlake who I am not surprised to live up an over the top role to even Jones short but sweet participation are all suited Although the stand out award I d like to give to Mr Armie Hammer His role is just Tailor fit literally as his jacket From his statuesque as a rower all through out as a dapper at Harvard he is just believable in that field He is after after all the Winklevoss BrotherS The Social Network is a significant film to be shown in this day of age People are at the coffee shops internet hubs computer room at their houses all wanting to be connected and have a connection socially of course This film is so evident that people are somehow meant to socialize I m not speaking as an expert here or whatever but by just witnessing all my friends and relatives speaking the lingo Facebook Me or Add Me As Your Friend is such a testament that we actually do care to care about other s lives I don t know if it s good but most people claim it s fun and so the rest of the film Based on my few learnings about this movie Mark Zuckerberg just like many other guys got the better out of him because of a girl and the inevitable Heartbreak which on the other hand brings out the best out of a man Then subsequently enforced him out to build the phenomenal Facebook or should I say The Facebook com The way I see it Zuckerberg in the film doesn t really know how to properly socialize in public and maybe it is in real life But we all know all of it doesn t matter anymore for he just founded the biggest and most influential social connector existing in our technological world today Facebook is his outlet I think it is part genius and part love which in the last scene of the film tells you it is a social vindication out of a sullen admiration,9
23 January 2011,David Mamet's Animal House,The Social Network is a boring movie about annoying people who d impress with intellect but not with intelligence and it is set in a land where everything is brown Why Well because it is That s cool right In real life Facebook is boring It is the social pornography millions are addicted to where everybody posts pictures of all the parties they go to and beefcake or women they meet but it s not a scene you can actually hook up on for real so strange It is something I ll never understand IMDb com is cool Who doesn t want to rate movies But Facebook Grow fake crops Add friends But no beer Lame The Social Network is a dry talky and lifeless odyssey about why we should care Well not really A Lifetime TV movie in all but name The Social Network chronicles the rise of the Facebook phenomenon and eccentricity of Mark Zuckerbeg but it doesn t succeed in making the topic interesting This is Real Genius but minus any actual dramatic investment or humor David FIncher uses a deft deadpan touch and Trent Reznor funk to jazz it up but the problem is this is a movie about people making a website I INVENTED FACEBOOK NO WAY MAN I INVENTED FACEBOOK Yeah they do that for two hours Oh the humanity Puleeeez Just as a story of becoming a millionaire is no longer an interesting topic being wowed by how many millions of hits facebook gets is weaksauce How is this interesting The Social Network is simply not grand or impressive enough for me to be wowed by a bunch of hoodie geeks fighting over vaporware But at least it does echo the millions of dorks yeah that means all of you FB junkies fighting over who is being friended or defriended in cyberspace by people they hardly if ever talk to It s true The lower the stakes the harder they fight Even if that is the whole point at the end of the day it s still boring There is only so much you can do to dress up a turd,3
18 July 2012,"An overall good, yet over-hyped ride",I ve got to admit I was not entirely enthusiastic about a movie based on Facebook For one I didn t really enjoy the website and I didn t see why everyone was so obsessed with it Secondly I didn t think that the material in the movie would be all that fascinating seeing as it was about making a website Big Whoop But boy was I wrong While the basis of this movie is about building a website the fundamentals are not At the heart of this movie are the relationships that were built the relationships that grew and the relationships that were lost What sucked me in was not all the mathematics and computer mumbo jumbo something that as a non computer scientist I didn t understand Rather the dynamics between the characters are what resonated with me Jesse Eisenberg plays Mark Zuckerberg with such a delicate mix of iciness and shyness that in some scenes you don t know which one he is really portraying He pulls of the fast dialogue really well and although you tend to fall towards the hate side throughout the movie by the end he ll still manage to leave you feeling sympathetic to his case Although I have to say if this is Mark in real life the movie did not do much to make him look heroic Andrew Garfield does a spectacular job of playing Eduardo Saverin Mark s best friend and initial co founder of Facebook He conveys a sympathetic honest and kind spirit about Eduardo and we can all root for him as well as relate to him This is a story of a friendship gone wrong and in the climatic final scene when Garfield really lets loose is when the performance is at its strongest Other notable characters are Justin Timberlake who proves he can act and FINALLY be hated as a slimy get under your skin all around annoying Sean Parker which means he is doing his job well seeing as that was the goal as well as Armie Hammer who impresses by donning a double role as the winklevoss twins Overall don t see this movie for girls who did not add anything special to the plot and shouldn t have even been there or even really for facebook But see it for the impressive portrayals and for the relationships built You ll root for some you ll hate some and overall you ll enjoy the movie,8
2 October 2010,It's not about Facebook; it's a story of ambition in a high stakes modern world,You d be hard pressed to think of a film concept more socially relevant and relatable to 500 million people than a movie about the origins of Facebook The Social Network however is not some insouciant attempt to capitalize on the world s most popular social networking site for revenue purposes It is a loaded drama that unlike most based on true stories is a bit unforgiving of its protagonist or anyone else for that matter and unafraid to handle the unflattering side of human nature Check the idea of this being a Facebook movie aside this is the story of what can happen in today s age when an arguably stolen idea can be born at a frat party and turn into a 25 billion dollar property in fewer than 10 years We learn right away that our quick tongued smart allick main character Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg is special After the opening scene finds him dumped by his girlfriend Rooney Mara for obsessing over winning social approval from the elite Harvard clubs and insulting her in the process he goes back to his dorm pounds a few beers and writes a website code for evaluating the comparative hotness of Harvard girls using the his best friend Eduardo Saverin s Andrew Garfield algorithm and pictures he hacked off the women s clubs sites We re then overwhelmed with techno babble in this early scene that one can t help but realize not just anybody could ve created Facebook Although we re certainly not asked to like Zuckerberg we never find him so deplorable that the film becomes intolerable The first of many contentious actions in the story involves Zuckerberg using the idea of Harvard boys Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss as the springboard for creating Facebook With the excitement of watching Facebook unfurl also comes the web of deceit The script doesn t give Eisenberg many redeeming moments to work with but the humanity comes through just as much as the jerky characterization in his performance It doesn t take very long to get hooked into The Social Network The pacing of David Fincher s film is exquisite the scenes are meticulously calculated and never let up on drama or intrigue with the lone exception being an overextended rowing scene analogy toward the end But the highlight is certainly The West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin s script sharp intelligent thought provoking and seamlessly telling two narratives at once as the film jumps between the story of Facebook s creation and the present day civil suits filed by Eduardo and the Winklevosses separately Throw Trent Reznor s cool mood generating electronic score underneath and you have one of the better produced films in a while The Social Network certainly has a share of live horses in the Oscar race Anchoring it all are these young blossoming actors Fincher has a reputation for bringing along remarkable talents just look at what he did with Brad Pitt and Eisenberg and Garfield might be two of the best in their generation Eisenberg will shed the Michael Cera comparisons with this performance but Garfield future Spider Man really impresses It s possibly because his character earns the most sympathy but his confrontation scene with Mark is powerful If the best actor categories weren t such gentleman s clubs these two would certainly be there The strength of The Social Network lies in the ability to show the flaws in every character and to make us realize that in the shoes of Mark and Eduardo we would have made just as many mistakes When Justin Timberlake s character Sean creator of Napster enters the picture and starts trying to sell the boys on becoming billionaires we begin to see how unforgiving the business world can be Mark might have done some questionable things but he kept himself afloat Eduardo might have been cautious and pragmatic but he got lost in the shuffle So The Social Network is not the film that defines our times It s not about social networking but a story of ambition and dreaming big and the harsh realities of the business world That s a timeless motif not a modern one Sure there are plenty of nuggets for those fans of Facebook who will enjoy the moment when Mark realizes to put relationship status on the site or when the Facebook wall is referenced but that merely dresses the film up as with the times If anything it shows how we live in a world today where there s a value on intellectual property and it s a high stakes competition to turn ideas into tremendous revenue So how can you fault these kids for the mistakes they made It s a lot for anyone to handle The Social Network helps us recognize that admitting fault and making amends after the fact is sometimes the best you can do Steven C Visit my site at http moviemusereviews com,9
17 June 2020,Boring,This Movie Was So Boring I Hated Every Minute Of It In My Opinion Stay Far Away From This Movie,1
31 August 2017,Should have been a contender,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,9
13 October 2010,Underwhelming,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,5
14 October 2010,Get under the hood of a person who is changing the world as we know it,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,10
27 November 2014,A great Jesse Eisenberg performance!!,The Social Network 2010 is a very good film but I m surprised it hasn t been crippled by a deluge of libel suits Jesse Eisenberg is tremendous as the fast talking hyper programming Mark Zuckerberg the founder of Facebook But is the real Mark so blinkered into effecting his own genius as the film portrays even hinting that Mark is responsible for certain acts of base treachery Is Sean Parker played by Justin Timberlake really the ruthless manipulating hedonist as displayed in the film Is Eduardo Saverin played by Andrew Garfield really the naive no hoper displayed here I ve been working with computers for over 30 years and somewhat over awed by the Young Turks of the Internet but I really didn t learn that much about the workings of Facebook What I did get was a master class in the nastiness of humans determined to get to the top regardless or as the Bible puts it gain the whole world but lose their souls It s a film that really leaves a bad taste in the mouth One that I ll visit again because it s very well made but not very often Worth an 8,8
13 July 2013,A Brilliant Entertaining Look at the Facebook Success!,Jesse Eisenberg earned a well deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in playing Mark Zuckerberg the genius behind Facebook This film recounts the history and the court case against him The film flashes back between the depositions and the real life accounts The supporting cast is first rate and the writing is nearly perfect Justin Timberlake is fantastic as Sean Parker the Napster genius who mentors the young college students behind Facebook Jesse s Mark isn t a likable character at times Mark comes across as a jerk and obsessed with Facebook s success The Harvard students are just like everybody else We see Mark move to Silicon Valley where he rents a house across the street from Sean Parker We see how Mark screws his best friend and business partner Eduardo who is a likable character torn between his devotion to Facebook and reality The cast is first rate and I can see why this film got several accolades,9
26 September 2018,"The filmmaking is all top-notch, but the story's analytical approach dampens its effect somewhat.",The filmmaking is all on fine form in The Social Network 2010 which you essentially always expect from a David Fincher flick regardless of if it has an Arron Sorkin screenplay under the hood There are for all intents and purposes no faults to be found whatsoever when it comes to this aspect of the piece s production the quick firing quick witted script meshes wonderfully with the astutely self assured direction and the almost sickly slick cinematography The movie only goes so far in being an entertaining experience however mainly because it has a somewhat seedy feel to it and it usually takes a more hands off analytical approach to its focal events It always feeling like there s something slightly off at its just out of reach centre ironically this is perhaps a fantastic allegory for both the central character and his ever expanding creation Still there s no doubt that this is a compelling story that sinks its teeth into you and ultimately leaves things up to audience interpretation mainly in terms of who you feel is right and who you want to root for while also including a number of nuanced performances that make that decision a lot harder than it might at first seem 7 10,7
29 April 2020,Great story emphasized by superb acting from Jesse Eisenberg,Overall was a very captivating movie even with already knowing the ending to the story What was a great performance from Jesse Eisenberg Mark Zuckerberg was slightly brought down by the other members of the cast The performances by Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake cracked the surface of the people they were representing but fell short of creating an impact like we saw with Mark Zuckerberg s character Great story script and more powerful than expected,8
12 February 2011,An average celebrity movie,They did it all before the movie about some famous person that lives his life in a somewhat higher state of existence than anybody else yet has human problems and deals with them while the story of their great idea is being told I ve seen stuff like that made about Einstein and the only different thing is that it is based in a college environment and the celebrity is still alive and that everything has to be put on fast forward because it is happening with young cool people They even have Justin Timberlake in it eeaayy Now is it a bad film Not at all It does what it is supposed to do It brings the drama and the story together while conveying the feeling that anyone can do it if they are focused enough And that s the main push of the story genius is different and you must allow for some issues and forget uncommon behaviour Einstein was Jewish too and kind of an asshole as well but he was brilliant You might think that I am making a leap comparing these two guys but it is not me it is the makers of the film that made the two media personnas as similar as to draw connection Mark Zuckenberg was a pretty pathetic human being but that was the kind of thing that made him able to push away every distraction and devote his life to a purpose Put this way anything is easy to do certainly easier than when you are also trying to have a life He was also inspired by others and it shows in the film which is the best part of the movie if you ask me Bottom line average film obviously altered story for dramatic purpose everything looking really fast because it just had to feel dynamic but good production quality and good acting A masterpiece it is not and I can see this film split into little scenes that then are montaged together in a Discovery Channel celebrity show It does give food for thought as it shows you have to start early and get there first but also that for the same reasons the vast majority of people could never do that,7
19 October 2010,"""Like""",I saw this much buzzed film in an advanced screening yesterday and I must say it lives up to its hype I was really doubtful how anyone could charge up a story about such sedate topics as computer and business and create a generally engaging movie However watching The Social Network dispels those doubts This movie shows us how the Facebook came to life It seems that hell hath no fury like a computer geek scorned From that one night when Mark Zuckerberg was rejected by Erica Albright events were set into motion that led to the creation of an internet phenomenon The subsequent events involving friendship inspiration back stabbing and double cross that drives this story forward It is said that the story was derived from court documents Zuckerberg himself denies the story happened exactly that way We will never really know how much of this is false testimony or dramatic license The lead actor Jesse Eisenberg perfectly plays the flawed protagonist Mark who was so self absorbed that you d hate him yet still admire him for his talent and drive Justin Timberlake plays Napster founder Sean Parker who was instrumental to push Facebook into the big time This character was written to be so annoying and Justin succeeds to annoy On the other side Andrew Garfield sympathetically plays Edward Saverin Mark s only friend and financier in Harvard and alleged victim of Facebook s rise into the financial stratosphere Comic relief was provided by the Winklevii twins who turned out was just portrayed by only one actor Armie Hammer Good camera trickery there Also you will be surprised by what the foxy Brenda Song ex Disney s Wendy Wu will do here However as a movie The Social Network works The script of Aaron Sorkin best known for writing The West Wing is very rich and witty The direction of acclaimed director David Fincher was sure and precise following the tradition of his previous films like Se7en and Zodiac Yes this is a movie with a lot of talk but the pace cinematography and editing were all on point It was not boring at all as the atmosphere is kept interesting and tense despite the techno babble and legalese If this movie were a Facebook page I would click LIKE,9
8 July 2020,Masterpiece,First off The Social Network directed by David Fincher and written by Aaron Sorkin I mention the names because both are largely responsible to what this film is a masterpiece The Social Network has one of the best screenplays of any movie ever The dialogue is snappy fast paced delivered with pinpoint precision but most of all it s meaningful Every word holds meaning and none of it detracts from the story Every conversation serves its purpose in moving the story forward and all of it is such believable dialogue The film s story centers around the creation of Facebook and although most of this film isn t accurate to what actually happen every aspect of the true story that could be used for a dramatic purpose was utilized Everything just works so well together in this movie the story the places the age of the characters the style the performances everything is done so wonderfully This is one of those movies where you think about it for days after seeing it and so much of it still sticks closely with you This is a modern masterpiece and I could go on dissecting every element of the film for hours with how carefully crafted it is but I ll leave it at that The Social Network gets an 8 5 10 My Rating System 1 10 hot garbage 2 10 really bad 3 10 pretty bad 4 10 bad 5 10 meh ok fine 6 10 good 7 10 pretty good 8 10 really good 8 5 10 threshold to be considered a masterpiece 9 10 amazing 10 10 perfect,8
20 August 2013,Out Come The Geeks,Who would have thought a feature film could have been made about a bunch of nerdy students creating a web site I suppose though in the time honoured fashion of the likes of The Paper Chase Cider House Rules and Good Will Hunting there can be gold in campus drama although the difference here of course is that this isn t fiction being an account of how Mark Zuckerburg with a little help from his friends got the concept of Facebook out of his head and onto the market making billions in the process You d have thought mind you that was more than enough money for him to share rather than allow himself to be embroiled in high profile and no doubt expensive court cases by some of the people he trod on and used to get to the top but thin as it is that s the premise for the movie Right from the start director Fincher shows Zuckerburg in an unflattering light a geeky self centred pretentious student who expects everyone to bow down to his intellect but after his then girlfriend dumps him a petty act of revenge on her leads to his Eureka moment in setting up an online club appealing principally to the young set The film is highly watchable due to the pacey direction and Aaron Sorkin s ear for needle sharp dialogue but some posters here are right when they say that this film probably wouldn t work as fiction at all and it s only our real life interest in the background to one of the biggest business success stories of modern times which compels our attention Certainly there are no likable main characters here besides the venal Zuckerburg his meal ticket friend and partner Eduardo Saviano seems just too gullible to be true while Napster king Sean Parker ruthlessly lords it over his adoring acolytes in repellent messianic rock star style I almost wished that Zuckerburg s girlfriend stayed in the film throughout she turns up briefly again later as she seemed by far the most credible and sympathetic character here Seems to me she should have shared in the mega wealth too as she inadvertently inspired Zuckerburg in the first place The acting by the leads is very good none better than Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerburg plus there s an excellent modern soundtrack courtesy of Trent Raznor On the debit side there s some uncalled for gratuitous sex and Justin Timberlake is too big a celebrity to play big nobody Parker On the whole I d probably hit the Like button for this film but consider it a bit overrated both by the Academy where it received a Best Film Oscar nomination and probably the public at large including the community here,6
1 July 2019,my notes,Decent overall typical story movie nothing specific i disliked just didn t care for it much 1 viewing,5
3 October 2010,Social Propaganda,I found the movie Social Network useful in gaining an outline of how Facebook came to be However I do not trust any movie rendition of real life characters After watching the movie I did follow up research to understand better the events of the story That research showed that Eduardo Saverin was instrumental in getting the book Accidental Billionaires written as a character assassination of Mark Zuckerberg and Sean Parker I don t know if Mark Zuckerberg is as self absorbed as presented in the movie nor whether he was mesmerized by the cunning of Sean Parker But I doubt it The movie presents Saverin as complete victim and the Winklevoss brothers as noble but petty finaglers who had an idea yet did nothing with it except sue for wealth from Zuckerberg I have no fondness for Facebook I was on it for about a year and later discovered that they are retaining all data that we put on their site to sell to marketers hence their billions of dollars profit It is ironic that Zuckerberg hacked into the Harvard computer system to gain the jpegs of all the girls on campus for his Facemash then later comes up with the system where all the private data is given to him voluntarily This information is available for the government whose quest it is to profile every American for surveillance reasons Google is doing the same and I have since stopped using their search engine It was very difficult to get my data removed When you close your Facebook account they do not delete the data and you have to go through various hidden pages to get the data deleted Even then I am not sure that it is deleted since I am still getting Facebook spam months later Before they got they first 500 million dollars investment they wanted to keep their site cool Now that it is a giant mega corporation it is not cool but creepy Zuckerberg is not cool but filthy rich Perhaps Bill Gates was cool at one time but they are both part of the globalist elites now,7
5 June 2017,Manipulative corporate propaganda.,DON T WATCH THIS MOVIE I m serious if you want to I can t stop you so here s the premise Zuckerberg is an everyman and underdog a grinning charmless suburban geek that wants to change the world by connecting people the villains of the piece are US blue blooded preppies that believe they are the rightful lead in a type of tech social media platform race that becomes what we know of as Facebook But what is Facebook It s an omnipresent surveillance based global software that relies enormously on the sharing of content for which it nor consumers ever pay This film although handled with excellent balance and dramatic treatment and no shortage of wit seems to make no mention of the fact that our best journalists artists musicians documentarians animators and designers are paid nothing 0 00 for a media sharing platform that earns nearly 40 billion dollars a year in revenue and directs United States government policy making and collects all your personal data for marketing algorithms and public surveillance The image of Zuckerberg in his hooded sweater grinning naively with a soft drink in hand is actually the sound of the Western arts and media economy being flushed down the toilet and while there is an angle to this film it makes little sense for any thinking individual to respect it s purported little guy makes good myth,2
2 January 2011,The Origins And Evolution Of Facebook,As someone who is admittedly a fan of Facebook although I m certainly no addict at least that s my story and I m sticking to it and I m going to post it as my Facebook status just so everyone knows I have been looking forward to seeing this movie about the origins and early evolution of the most successful social networking site on the internet It does not disappoint It s a fast paced some might say frenetically paced in places account of how Mark Zuckerberg became as the movie notes in its closing captions the youngest billionaire in the world by developing the site and of the various relationships that were built and destroyed in the process Jesse Eisenberg was absolutely convincing as Zuckerberg who comes across in this as the stereotypical computer geek he has a certain nerdy likability but nevertheless has few social skills few friends and an obsession with computer programming Zuckerberg s basic personality or at least what this movie wants us to think is his basic personality I ve never met the guy so who knows if it s true is brilliantly brought out in a hilarious opening scene of Zuckerberg on a date with Erica The date goes horribly wrong Due to his social ineptness Zuckerberg insults Erica without meaning to and without even realizing it gets told to take a hike and then angrily goes back to his Harvard dorm gets drunk and still proceeds to blog about the experience in terms quite insulting and embarrassing to Erica while at the same time developing an immediately popular website that manages to insult a significant portion of the female population at Harvard His work brings him to the attention of the Winklevoss brothers who want to set up a social networking site for in house use at Harvard and enlist Zuckerberg to help them The rest as they say is history as Zuckerberg takes their idea and builds on it without giving them any credit Zuckerberg doesn t come across well in this He s arrogant and egotistical and yet at the same time there s admittedly a certain admirable quality to him He s devoted committed and totally unconcerned with money But he also comes across as easily manipulated falling in with Napster founder Sean Parker played by Justin Timberlake who comes across far worse than Zuckerberg who helps him build Facebook but at the expense of his relationship with his friend perhaps his only real friend Eduardo Savarin Andrew Garfield who had been the co founder of The Face Book its only investor for a long time the company s CFO and had devoted himself to trying to hustle advertising to generate revenue If there s a truly sympathetic figure in this it s Savarin who ends up being almost totally cut out of Facebook and escorted by guards out of the company s California offices The movie revolves around a couple of legal proceedings Zuckerberg obviously after Facebook has become a mega success is being sued by both the Winklevoss brothers and Savarin and the story unfolds as testimony is offered in the respective cases It s fascinating to watch and for anyone with an interest in social networking or who is in any way connected to others via Facebook it has to be rated as a must see movie,8
13 June 2011,Fincher applies his usual dark style to this intriguing and relevant story,STAR RATING Saturday Night Friday Night Friday Morning Sunday Night Monday Morning For such a young guy I m still worryingly over whelmed by all the technology that controls the world these days you seem to have mobile phones where people can watch films download music connect to the internet music devices that can download tunes on the go and doing the rounds on the internet itself at the moment social networking sites seem to be all the rage mainly Twitter and arguably the most popular Facebook I fail to see the big rage to be honest intermittently informing other users of the most mundane aspects of your day trying to out compete others with how many messages you can send at one time and so forth But still FB has millions of followers worldwide and has made it s founder Mark Zuckerberg the youngest millionaire on the planet This film charts how Zuckerberg played by Jesse Eisenberg used his social alienation and nerdishness to set him on his way to founding Facebook before it s money making potential became evident and he began to turn on his friends as he became more ruthless making his way to the top or so the film claims At first glance the material doesn t feel suited to the dark content director David Fincher is more renowned for and so he s an odd choice to be at the helm here Still his heavy brooding style is felt all over the picture and adds it a layer of authenticism and style that it otherwise wouldn t have had In the lead role Eisenberg weird his and his character s name both end in berg brings the character of Zuckerberg to life quite well showing an already tactless and socially awkward person descend further into a ruthless predatory and traitorius monster although this is a dubious depiction by the film It is curious that such a socially challenged guy could be responsible for creating the biggest social networking site in the world And it has to be said praise is owed to Justin Timberlake in a supporting role showing more range and depth than could be reasonably expected of an ex member of N Sync This is an unusual but timely and relevant piece for a director like Fincher to take on and applying his usual cold dark style he has achieved quite an admirable result indeed,9
3 October 2010,Not My Favorite (spoilers),I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,7
2 October 2010,A Solid Win For All Involved.,Mark Zuckerberg is dumped by his girlfriend in the opening scene and in a drunken rage he goes online and hacks into different websites to take student photos and create a site called FaceMash where people pick which girl is hotter This leads to some academic probation but it catches the eyes of three other students who want to create a social networking site that would be exclusive to Harvard students They tell Zuckerberg the idea and he joins the team Unfortunately Zuckerberg shuts them off from communication and writes his own codes and brings in his best friend as CFO Thus The Facebook is born As the site gets more popular Zuckerberg loses his connection with his best friend and ends up getting sued by him and the three students for millions of dollars When I first heard that there was going to be a movie based on Facebook I rolled my eyes and asked why even bother Then to my surprise I heard that David Fincher was set to direct My interest perked up a little bit after all the guy directs some stellar films It wasn t until the trailers starting popping up did I really want to see this film The accolades that it has been receiving added more anticipation Now that I ve seen the film all I can say is bravo Fincher and soon to be nominated for best adapted screenplay Aaron Sorkin have created a film that defines what this generation is all about Facebook is such a cultural impact that some people can t live their lives without it I have it open in another window as I m writing this review right now The film will undoubtedly receive more award nominations than screenplay I m just curious to see if any of those are in the acting department because this cast is great Jesse Eisenberg who people always claimed to be a Michael Cera rip off commands the screen with his awkward and pseudo intelligent riffs in his speeding bullet laced monologues The guy Zuckerberg is brilliant at code writing but his social skills are clearly lacking His best friend Eduardo Saverin soon to be Spiderman Andrew Garfield is desperate to get into elite clubs and has his emotions close to the surface Eventually they explode when he learns he s being shifted out of his CFO position Garfield plays well opposite Eisenberg To my surprise Justin Timberlake wasn t irritating He plays egocentric Sean Parker and while I don t see any awards heading his way he does help complete a well put together cast The story jumps between two timelines The present in which Zuckerberg is facing two lawsuits and the past which we see the creation of facebook Heaps of praise should be thrown on Fincher and Sorkin they pulled off this structure perfectly The film feels just like his previous efforts dark and cold Much like the depiction of Zuckerberg I can t comment on how true the film depicts the events but we all know he did get sued and the filmmakers stand by the truths they tell in this film It s all heightened to be entertaining but with Zuckerberg trying to steer clear I see a lot of truth in this film The Social Network is one of the years best films It s solid direction from Fincher who knows what he wants from every aspect Sorkin delivers a timeless story set in our age of the internet and facebook Friendship greed and loyalty are all called into question The performance are strong across the board with such a young cast Eisenberg standing out in the lead role of Zuckerberg The score is phenomenal Fincher knew what he wanted and he got it with Trent Reznor His style of music perfectly matches the film with the technology it s bringing to the forefront I wouldn t call this the film of the decade but it is good enough to be in the high ranks of Fincher s best work and one of the best works this year For a film that is simply people talking it feels natural and goes at a breakneck speed I highly recommend The Social Network,9
16 May 2021,Entertaining Despite Reality,I have now seen this movie 3 times Whether or not you like or agree with Mark Zuckerberg or any of the other people portrayed in the movie this is an excellent movie and very entertaining regardless the reality behind it The acting is superb the script directing everything is excellent Though Mark Zuckerberg is not person that I would ever friend on Facebook I would highly recommend this movie,8
11 October 2010,"Aside from Inception, The Social Network is a movie not to be missed.",I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,10
26 January 2011,Cheap Hollywood clichéd movie.,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,1
19 February 2021,Zuckerberg's Personality Traits.,I didn t much like this originally In essence it s a well produced film exhibiting Fincher Sorkin Reznor s talents Not only this but it exhibits Zuckerberg s personality traits which portrays him in a certain unflattering light This also makes him driven enough to be now considered as one of the Big Tech elite An intriguing film but not a person I would aspire to be,7
18 November 2010,"Rags to riches story, but is someone's soul at stake here?",Funny thing about The Social Network is that it started life as that Facebook movie even with Fincher s name attached almost anything that wasn t a string of facebook relationship statuses updated would seem like a knockout success then people started pouring out of theaters in raving enthusiasm about how good it actually is expectations were miraculously installed and now I m forced to write surreal things like that Facebook movie is not that good That Facebook movie is not that good There s a scene early on that annoyed me As a bunch of computer geeks huddle around a computer screen to find cool hackster ways to get back at girls for not giving them any we see a busload of young college girls all dressed up to please unloaded at the doorstep of a very exclusive Harvard club Once inside they dance on laps and strip and are excited to be pawed by spoiled rich kids That s not to say either of the two parts of that scene don t happen in real life or shouldn t happen in a film but the juxtaposition is jarring It s almost like the film is saying those same girls deserve to be treated as pretty face fodder for online voting contests because they are sluts I had forgotten all the negative things I was hearing about that rowing scene until it came up on screen What the hell was Fincher thinking His visual style for the duration was so mute and perfunctory that when he decides to flex his muscles like a recluse who hasn t talked to another human being for a week will speak in an awkward voice the results are cringeworthy I haven t scene more out of place mood killers since the time Pino Donaggio was scoring lame funky comic relieves for Brian DePalma in Carrie Which brings me to that style I don t like Fincher s toilet stain brown in anything but this is muted by another remove The Social Network has all the visual imagination of a newspaper which is not bad for it because it s trying to be the newspaper It s all fact and he said that and then I said that talky like a stageplay and I don t like talky films any more than I like the theatre and even introduces a dual flashback structure that is more framing device because nothing meaningful happens within the flashbacks I don t want to make claims for pure cinema because that would mean some kind of impure cinema exists as second choice for those still apprenticing to reach a cinema of higher order but I wish more of what goes on here was translated in visual means Like the happy days are over metaphor of the shot of coming clouds casting a shadow over tall buildings I like these rags to riches stories to be Shakespearean to end in tragic hopeless notes to take me to heights as a means of plunging me to black depths of the soul from where a future can t be surmised The Citizen Kane comparisons are not completely without merit but CK ends with a panoramic shot of a huge warehouse filled with boxes of his things memories of life ready to be carted away Kane is not there but the loneliness of the image chills my bones Zuckerberg is alone at the end of Fincher s movie but he s alone at a business room with a laptop and an apprentice attorney offers to order something to eat for him He s not spent and damned like Daniel Plainview he f cked up but he s only starting out The final glimpse into the soul of a man who made it to the top and is alone there is Zuckerberg refreshing a Facebook page What I mean to say is that his damnation doesn t ring throughout eternity for me I never feared for his soul I can see an easy bright future ahead of this man who is young and rich and healthy the fall is not deep enough and so the rise is equally irrelevant to me,
17 November 2020,Movie to justify the most unethical billionaire,Let s face the facts The movie is only 40 true Mark Zuckerberg and his company steals data of non Facebook users steal videos from original content creators and make money showing ads on them A movie to glorify the guy is just wrong and definitely biased,1
22 October 2010,disappointing,I do not really understand the hype over this movie I understand the Facebook craze as I use it myself but so many good reviews for such a mediocre movie is just surprising I didn t want to see it at first as I thought that one cannot turn such a contemporary and known story into a good movie but when I heard so many good opinions from people around me I decided to give it a chance And I left the movie theater really disappointed Apart from a good idea of the plot being intertwined in two lawsuits and a couple of nice scenes like the row race in the UK wonderfully filmed the movie is just impossibly schematic and let s not be afraid to use this word boring I am a fan of Jesse Eisenberg but even he couldn t get over that lame script And what is with the obligatory 2 hours of a movie nowadays even if the authors do not have that much of a story to tell What happened to the good old 90 minute movies Instead of longer movie for my money I would prefer better value for my money,3
11 March 2017,A Film Worthy Of Its Subject Matter,Facebook changed the world it s as simple as that It deserved a film up to the par of that momentous for better or worse revolution and that s exactly what director David Fincher provides For a very basic overview The Social Network tells the story of Facebook s creation and subsequent legal battles It is told primarily via flashbacks through the recollections of creator Mark Zuckerberg Jessie Eisenberg and former best friend Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield as they wade through the various lawsuits There are three areas in which this movie really shines 1 Direction There is no dull moment in this film Fincher really keeps things hopping and upbeat as befitting a movie about the greatest social invention perhaps of all time Very deserving of his Oscar nomination 2 Acting Only in the best of movies can outside the box casting choices make you not feel as if they are out of place For example Brenda Song best known as the ditzy London Tipton of Disney Channel fame plays essentially a Facebook groupie while Justin Timberlake shines as Sean Parker founder of Napster who has a major influence on Zuckerberg in the Facebook development process Armie Hammer has the unique opportunity to play both halves of the now infamous Winklevoss twins Remarkably all these castings work perfectly 3 Ideas Besides just a summary of Facebook s creation the true genius behind this movie is the ideas notions it stirs up The definition of copyright the creative process and the definition of friendship are all themes that are swished around during the movie No grand conclusions or black and white summations are given Instead it is left up to the viewer to decide on the ethics of what just transpired This remains true if not perhaps even more so a solid decade after the film s release when the overall importance of social media is slightly better understood Thus I consider The Social Network to be one of the most unique biopics I have ever seen The combination of strong societal implications Fincher s direction Aaron Sorkin s dialogue Trent Reznor s music and Eisenberg s quirky Zuckerberg make every scene engaging in some way I m clicking the Like button on this one,10

19 September 2010,We learn nothing of facebook or who created it. This is the action movie of litigation films.,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,3
22 March 2011,Geek Tragedy,This film chronicles the founding of the website Facebook The story is told in flashbacks turning a simple tale into a rather clumsy narrative It is somewhat of a geek tragedy in that Zuckerberg the founder of the most successful social network ever built is a social misfit basically a rude arrogant jerk Yes it s the story of the little guy who makes it big but the little guy is such a wet blanket that one can t root for him Eisenberg delivers his lines so rapidly that one has to strain to understand what he s saying Sprinking the dialog with technical jargon doesn t help matters It s entertaining for the most part but never rises above mediocrity,7
3 October 2010,One of those rare movies that is perfect.,This movie is simply amazing Everything about it just amazes me The dialogue is fantastic the acting is wonderful and the direction is perfect First thing I really want to talk about when it comes to this masterpiece is the acting Everyone and I mean EVERYONE is excellent The performance that surprised the most was Jesse Eisenberg I loved him in Zombieland and Adventureland but here he will amaze you With his roles in Zombieland and Adventureland he was hilarious but here he shows more range then you thought an actor could ever have He goes from two funny roles to an amazing dramatic role Now I know that many people who have not seen the movie will call me crazy but I think that Jesse Eisenberg deserves the Oscar for Best Actor I also will go farther by saying that his performance is one of the finest I have ever seen in a film Andrew Garfield is also fantastic in his role as Eduardo Saverin Justin Timberlake is one to mention also Justin should stop singing and stay in the movies because he is excellent in this movie as Sean Parker One last person I would like to mention is Brenda Song Many of you may know her as London Tipton in The Suite Life of Zack and Cody At that point you probably doubt that she will impress you but you would be wrong In her role as Christy Lee she shows how she is more than just some actor from a stupid Disney show In her role she is very good and I hope that she looks for more roles like this Then there is the excellent dialogue The lines are fast witty and full charisma It shows what these characters are like just through their mannerisms We also have the excellent direction from David Fincher This movie is just so well put together throughout Not one camera angle doesn t work This film has become my new favorite film of 2010 and I hope that this wins a lot of Oscars It is masterful 4 stars out of 4,10
2 October 2010,A True Story of Consumption and Betrayal,The Social Network has a quality in movies that isn t utilized enough It captures the feeling of living it while watching it After I watched The Social Network I felt I had lived the frustration hardships and everything in between dealt with by the film s protagonist Mark Zuckerberg Few movies have that unique quality and since many movies that are released now are poor rushed CGI messes The Social Network proves good films still exist out there Jesse Eisenberg is one of the many actors in the world today that is underrated yet hasn t done a bad movie He was funny and relatable in Zombieland quirky yet lovable in Adventureland and now he is smart and sophisticated playing quite possibly the biggest role in his filmography His portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg is pure gold and almost Oscar worthy showing off how capable he is of a highly potential filled role He shows off some clever one liners in the film and even brings his full acting talents together by showing off technical humor in the film as well The plot takes place in Harvard University in 2003 when Mark Zuckerberg s Eisenberg severe frustration after his breakup with his girlfriend leads him to posting several hate comments on his LiveJournal account Mark then hacks into various servers making Face Mash a site where people can rate the attraction of different women Zuckerberg faces charges after the hacking which leads Cameron Winklevoss Tyler Winklevoss both played by Armie Hammer and Divya Narendra Max Minghella to approach him and ask him if he would like to help them create a social networking site called ConnectU Zuckerberg accepts the offer but then goes to his friend Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield with a similar idea about creating a site where friends can post status updates pictures talk to other friends view other friends updates and so on calling it The Facebook Mark and Eduardo spend a weekend working on the the idea and eventually launch it calling it The Facebook like planned The Winklevoss twins are furious claiming Zuckerberg had stolen their idea for the website and are now suing him for breaking his word The film flashes back and forth from 2003 where Facebook started to when the lawsuit coincides with the part in the story Its a unique action the problem is it makes the film choppy My only complaint is I could see where the crew was going trying to go back and forth between the birth lawsuit Though it makes the film choppy and almost slows things down The Social Network runs for two hours when it could be cut back at least twenty minutes Although the choppiness doesn t deteriorate much from the premise of overall idea of the film I like this movie for many things mainly the script written perfectly by Aaron Sorkin which is one of the many things Oscar worthy about this film Not only does the screenplay satisfy to various degrees having heavy technical jargon and amazing dialog scenes it s director David Fincher does an amazing job holding the movie together and the effort amounts in this film are overall amazing Jesse Eisenberg like stated before deserves an Oscar for his profound performance in this film He is Mark Zuckerberg His looks attitude and characteristics show he perfectly capable playing a big name role The movie teaches life lessons too We see Napster s Sean Parker Justin Timberlake who gives a dynamite performance as well walk into the picture to assist Zuckerberg with his Facebook site and basically kicks Saverin out of the picture It shows that you need to keep your friends close Anyone can waltz in and take control of your life if you let them Don t put your friends aside for someone who loves your net worth more than the actual person Here s the story of two friends who s website creation split their lives apart from each other because of Zuckerberg s selfish move Rarely does a movie send a message so meaningful The Social Network is now my pick for best film of the year followed by Toy Story 3 then Easy A The Social Network could have easily been a poor lifeless retelling of the founding of one of the biggest social networking sites nowadays but it chose to be as good as it did While running long it still manages to tell the story and events in broad descriptive detail leaving no stone unturned Most of the movie s characters don t appear as the real thing at the same time the story not being all the way true you will get that with every movie based on true events The Social Network may anger Mark Zuckerberg but it s still an informative electric dark out of the ordinary mesmerizing film with little to complain about Fincher Eisenberg Sorkin and everyone involved with the film have a perfect movie on their hands One with a heart and soul Starring Jesse Eisenberg Andrew Garfield Justin Timberlake Brenda Song Rooney Mara Armie Hammer and Max Minghella Directed by David Fincher,10

9 September 2019,Like.,An imaginative and compelling depiction of a sympathetic yet clearly damaged individual showing you don t need charisma to conquer the world Obliquely about the tendency for us to want to be known yet guard ourselves but it s not preachy or sanctimonious about it The tone is breezy and comedic and gets dark at just the right moments,7
4 November 2010,Not Only a Spike on the 2010 Radar but a Refreshing Return to Razor-Sharp Filmmaking Precision,We get the film version of every best seller graphic novel comic book series war and topical phenomenon within reach And too frequently they re assessed on the strength of how committed they are to the source Numerous critics haven t liked The Social Network because it doesn t follow the facts The Guardian pondered whether a 26 year old entrepreneur truly ought to have his name muddied in a foggy fact fiction jumble for the movie going public s common entertainment Zuckerberg himself the film s core subject and fascinating protagonist said at a conference he really wished that nobody had made a movie about him at least while he was alive I fully understand and sympathize with these points Part of me feels it s unfair to not only fictionalize but hold up to public censure the short life of a twentysomething But this is a useless attitude toward evaluating movies What counts is whether a movie is high quality and gratifying not whether it s true to a novel play real life figure To be sure countless films are magnificent for the reason that they interpret their initial sources into cinema vernacular Gangs of New York s factually inaccurate sure but it s profoundly true to the import and reality of its depicted era and way of life Hitchcock was painstakingly lucid with facts in The Wrong Man but at the expense of the spirit and power of its characters Fincher s known for dark meticulous dramas that tap into contemporary society s anxieties and obsessions This one dashes through two hours of magnetic dialogue It makes an ironically incommunicable account lucid captivating Many might understandably think it hopeless to make a movie about a computer programmer as programming s just writing in a language nobody in the audience understands Still Fincher and Sorkin dramatize the Facebook phenomenon in language that carries the import of the social media revolution with the same degree of vibrance and wit that Network did To conjure up Facebook Zuckerberg needed to be familiar with next to zilch about relationships or human nature and this film s version of him isn t What he needed was the capacity to perceive a way to engage the human race in the small world phenomenon I maybe know 50 of my Facebook friends well 100 I added just for going to the same high school at the same time another 100 friends of friends I can t recall the last time I received a Request from anyone with whom I didn t share at least one Mutual Friend The film begins with a date between Zuckerberg and Erica He anxiously nurses a beer and speed talks through an uncompromising cross examination almost vicious one upmanship Erica breaks it off reprimands him leaves Erica a storybound character is correct but at that instant she puts Zuckerberg in business He goes home begins hacking into the facebooks of Harvard dorms to accumulate campus girls head shots He programs a page where they can be ranked for their attractiveness Chauvinistic and criminal this proves so trendy it crashes the campus servers After it s harvested by a humdrum website called The Harvard Connection Zuckerberg propagates it into Facebook Programming vernacular and methods are broadly recognized but it s he who discerns how he can associate them with a networking site Facebook s brilliance entails not mental keenness but its scheme of mingling self image with social interface Zuckerberg longs to hit back at all the Harvard prudes he wishes would like him so he absorbs them in a surrounding substance that s even now on the rise This is the very reason why I feel The Social Network deserves the Oscar win for Best Editing It has an associational effect of overtonally aggregating the nature of time various rhythms to energize the pace and intellectual shot by shot links to create an emotional version of the narrative rather than a plodding entrepreneurial dossier The depositions testimony makes it clear there s a case to be made against Zuckerberg many of them sins of omission It s left to the final crawl to explain how they turned out The point is to show an interaction of undergraduate chaos enormous amounts of money and manic energy Zuckerberg may have had the acument that produced Facebook but he didn t do it single handedly and the movie gets a recounting by cutting between various lawsuit depositions We gain understanding of the Harvard social structure a campus where skill enlists affluence and relations as achievement factors We meet the Winklevoss twins both played by Armie Hammer moneyed hunks who suppose Zuckerberg stole their idea We meet Eduardo Saverin played by a warmly relatable Andrew Garfield Zuckerberg s closest sole friend who was made CFO lent the enterprise the money that it required to commence and was driven away Most remarkably we meet Sean Parker the founder of two renowned momentous startups It s the capricious Parker fresh out of work but stretched out in celebrity and past triumph who seemed to be the only person to make Zuckerberg blink much less haul him into the big time He rationalized why Facebook needed to move to Silicon Valley Why more money would come from venture capitalists than Eduardo would ever boost with his humble calls to flush New Yorkers The dialogue has the pace spontaneity of Paddy Chayefsky or a Howard Hawks film Eisenberg who s concentrated on playing feeble or fastidious is an infrared homing beacon hunting his own goals Timberlake stunningly triumphs with the cunning task of playing Parker as both a strutting show off and someone who takes on Zuckerberg as an academic match We could see them as symbolic of the relationship between the real life story and this film,8
11 January 2019,Boring as,Sorry fans of this movie back then but now in 2019 this movie needs an up to date remake with the increasing unpopularity of Facebook Anyhow about the movie it absolutely bored me when I seen in in the cinemas Mark Zuckerberg looks like the sort of dude you would avoid having any friendship with coz he acts like some twit who doesn t value a friendship He treats everyone like they re disposable tissues uses once then throws it away and we have nearly two hours of watching this tech twit in action of buliding his empire which I ve personally more harm than good come from it Watching the grass grow is way more exciting as Zuckerberg and pals bulid their relationship status thrills ahoy I can t fathom that movie was made by the guy who gave us SE7EN in the 90s coz this social network is boring as,1
24 November 2010,Sorkin is the king,When you see the words written by Aaron Sorkin you know you are going to be watching something of quality and this film much like West Wing or Studio 60 follows that rule Sorkin is a poet with words and his dialogue flows so fluently through every scene of this film He loves language and uses it to make even the smallest of roles memorable Every character is real and three dimensional and that is a testament to Sorkins writing I don t really care about Facebook or how it was created but what I do care about is strong well crafted theatre TV and film and whenever Sorkin is attached I know that is what i m going to get Hats off to the men he is a genius,7
28 October 2010,Fincher is still the king,Can David Fincher make a bad movie well lets forget about Alien 3 The Social Network is so amazing on so many levels The story is captivating from the opening scene the scene between Mark Erica in the bar Sparking dialogue that leaps off the screen so many memorable lines in just the 1st scene alone The narrative hurtles along at such a pace doesn t really let up until about the last 10 minutes of the movie This is definitely a movie to watch a few times The acting is awesome the 3 lead actors are just great there are some excellent supports notably Rooney Mara It is incredible the way the leads are depicted very flawed often unlikeable people in so many ways Aaron Sorkin has written a really impressive screenplay got to get a nod at Acadamy Awards plays an exec in 1 scene There are so many great scenes the opening is outstanding the scene where Mark Zuckerberg looks at Sean partying through the window is really impressive too We just got home from seeing it it opened today i cant wait to go back But Im a Fincher fan even his worst movies Panic Room The Game are excellent His best Fight Club Seven Benjamin Button Zodiac are amongst my all time faves this is more in the Zodiac style Fincher for best director or Nolan Highly recommended what i would call a must see,9
26 November 2010,Doesn't Fully Connect,David Fincher has always been one of my favorite directors a visual stylist unafraid of pushing boundaries or putting his full effort into controversial and sometimes even grotesque scripts With the exception of Alien3 my affection for this auteur has maintained stable through the years even more difficult patience testing mainstream leaning works like Zodiac and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button maintain a human solidity and warmth at their labyrinth cores And hot on the trail of those mainstream leaning works comes The Social Network a film that has been hailed as capturing the Zeitgeist of our time embodied in Mark Zuckerberg played here by Jesse Eisenberg the founder of Facebook and while nobody ever said a Zeitgeist needed to be embraced by all I found the coldness of the film overall to be its most notable and most crippling aspect The film presents Zuckerberg as a motor mouthed self absorbed and socially inept college kid who in a fit of anger over a girl who has just snubbed him germinates the seed of Facebook over the course of a few drunken hours the film will return to the theme of romantic personal failure as the seed of vengeance through technology retribution more than once the remainder of The Social Network criss crosses between present day and flashback chronicling the bridges Zuckerberg burned as quickly as they were built and the wake of angry ripped off colleagues and contemporaries left in the dust as Facebook became the Internet s premier social networking site While Aaron Sorkin s whip cracking dialog all too often feels like a less endearing less caustic version of Mamet speak that is never as clever as it thinks it is the real surprise of The Social Network is the utter conventionality of Fincher s direction For a film as jam packed with characters as this we never feel especially close to anybody and Zuckerberg who is essayed with an admirable lack of grace couth and empathy by Eisenberg who dominates the proceedings is both loathsome and pathetic Perhaps a second viewing will be more fulfilling but for now The Social Network is a rather unappetizing contemporary history lesson without much beyond its incendiary content to recommend it Actually it is worth viewing for the fantastic minimalist score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross,6
3 October 2010,"Entertaining Flick, A Little Over-hyped",I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,7
13 March 2011,"We lived on farms, then we lived in cities, and now we're going to live on the internet!",I would have never thought that the beginnings of Facebook was Hot or Not I guess there is no accounting for the taste of college boys It was called Facemash Thge basis of the film based on Mark Zuckerberg s life is who really started Facebook The film jumps back and forth from a hearing on the matter to the past when it was created The icing on the cake was adding the relationship status so people could hook up and it wasn t long before he was with Malese Jow Sean Parker Justin Timberlake of Napster fame helped bring Facebook to the international sensation that it is Zuckerberg was a genius and Jesse Eisenberg really nailed the part It was a shame that for all his fame and money he still regretted losing his girlfriend Erica Rooney Mara It helps if you know the companies mentioned but I really believe you can enjoy the film by just focusing on the characters It was a blast,8
18 March 2017,"Talented Ensemble All Contribute to Create a ""Real Life"" Story of the New Age",Intriguing Interloping and a Look at something that the Majority of People Rarely get to See The Creative Process and Seedlings of an Idea that would become a World Wide Web Sensation Facebook previously known as The Facebook a Website that Tapped into a Base Desire of Social Interaction especially of the Young to find Like Minded Peers Friends and Mates It s one of those Things that is a Why didn t I think of that development in the Early Days of the Internet when Dot Coms were Crashing and the Web was finding its way Finding its way into the Hearts and Minds of a Generation and later the Whole World It was a Technology that became a Way of Life and two Decades later is still Forming the Consciousness of the People on the Planet A part of that WWW is Mark Zuckerberg s Website that Dominates Social Media along with Twitter and You Tube This is the Embryosis of that Website it s Growing Pains that Ends with the Celebration of One Million Subscribers it now has 500 times more But getting there is a Human Interest Story of Friends Acquaintances Rivals and Business Partners There is very Little Conflict in the Creative Process these Guys for the most part knew Their Craft and knew what They wanted to do The Conflict comes in the Form of Intellectual Property allegedly Stolen and Sued by the Winklevoss Twins and that Leads Us to Follow the Money There s Co Creator Eduardo Savarin the Financial Adviser and Friend and College Roommate of Zuckerberg who also Sues He is being Left Behind and Replaced with Sean Parker Creator of Napster It s an Artistically Crafted Movie by Director David Fincher Writer Aaron Sorkin and an Actor Ensemble that Includes Jesse Eisenberg Andrew Garfield Justin Timberlake and Armie Hammer The Pounding Soundtrack courtesy of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross The Film may be a bit Overrated but it is Compelling Cinema One of those that the Entire Production Contributes to its Overall Success both Artistically and Commercially Although it s Easy to Dismiss this as a Story of Spoiled Brats and Accidental Billionaires who Strain for the Everyman to Relate it certainly cannot be denied that it is a Story of the New Age,9
6 January 2021,A Constantly Intriguing Movie with Little Flaws,The Social Network is a great movie with only a couple of downfalls I really enjoyed the cast and I think that they were great at acting They played their characters very well and I think that Jesse Eisenberg did especially well as a socially awkward Mark Zuckerberg I realize that you are supposed to feel frustrated at certain points in the movie but I felt like I was too frustrated at the characters and it made the movie viewing kind of slow at the time Other than that the story has a lot of great moments where you are glued to your seat This is a movie that you should definitely watch if you ever have the time,8
21 January 2011,"""They just can't wrap their head around the idea that someone might build something because they like building things."" - Mark Zuckenberg",I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,9
25 September 2019,Just so perfect,Gage Mr Zuckerberg do I have your full attention Mark Zuckerberg stares out the window No Gage Do you think I deserve it Mark Zuckerberg looks at Gage What Gage Do you think I deserve your full attention Mark Zuckerberg I had to swear an oath before we began this deposition and I don t want to perjure myself so I have a legal obligation to say no Gage Okay no You don t think I deserve your attention Mark Zuckerberg I think if your clients want to sit on my shoulders and call themselves tall they have the right to give it a try but there s no requirement that I enjoy sitting here listening to people lie You have part of my attention you have the minimum amount The rest of my attention is back at the offices of Facebook where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room including and especially your clients are intellectually or creatively capable of doing pauses Mark Zuckerberg Did I adequately answer your condescending question The Social Network 2010 PG 13 120 min Biography Drama The plot follows as Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg creates the social networking site that would become known as Facebook he is sued by the twins who claimed he stole their idea and by the co founder who was later squeezed out of the business Who would have thought this was the history of Facebook well could be partly fictional and yet I must admit twas much different from the other socialnetwork themed movies I ve watched so far The director did an amazing job here as did the main cast The music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross set the tone perfectly The dialogues the cool that our young Zuckerberg played just everything about this movie fell in place to make it a hit I m sure facebook will be around for a long time so too will the legacy of this movie Or else why would people be watching a movie post almost a decade of its release,10
26 October 2011,The Antisocial Nerdwork,Mark Zuckerberg character is an unfunny version of Big Bang Theory s Dr Sheldon Cooper He speaks too fast doesn t care about anyone else is extremely arrogant and seems to be unfamiliar with any kind of ethics The Social Network is a film that shows how the facebook website was founded and the issues that happened between the creators I don t know if the story of this film is real or fictional but I really don t care The actors are pretty decent with exception of Justin Timberlake that doesn t look like an entrepreneur at all Actually he doesn t fit in any kind of character he should maybe just stick to his singing career Sadly this David Fincher s movie suffers from the same problem of all his other works it s too long They don t have enough interesting story for 120 minutes just like Se7en and Fight Club I believe David Fincher likes to extend his films for some unknown reason even thought there isn t enough plot for that In fact there isn t any character that you can admire or at least like so I just went them all to drop dead and end this whole mess All in all this seems to be just a Hollywood flick with a new subject made for those interested in pure entertainment and nothing else For those it may work but for me it didn t work even as pure entertainment,5
7 November 2010,Stunning,And fascinating this story of how the Facebook network was conceived born and implemented by the work of a young Harvard student against winds and tides of all kind We see how a small computer program turned quickly into a social network of friendship congregating now more than 1 000 000 members spread all over the world composing a nation of more inhabitants than most countries The movie is well directed and the cut is a very effective succession of short sequences whose conducting thread consists in the depositions in the lawsuits against Mark Zuckerberg the young student above mentioned motivated by the several legal complications his activities provoked These sequences contain a succession of flashbacks related to the questions and references that arose during those depositions in a very vivid rhythm in which the lively dialogues and the excellent acting of all the cast members play a no less important part I didn t cast a higher vote to this movie only because for all that its theme is not as important as to allow it,7
24 January 2023,How common boy change the world,As everyone knows this is a biographical film about the founder of Facebook Many people watch this film for the purpose of finding the way to success and knowing how to succeed Just like many Chinese people are scrambling to buy Ma Yun s books this is very funny Those successes can t be taken away by anyone because those successes belong to those celebrities You want to succeed You need to find your own way to succeed The film s response in China is not very strong There are many people who don t like the film very much I think it should be that I want to find the way to success through the film but I let them down This is also a very traditional biographical film Everything is very close to the real life of the protagonist Of course we can t describe the specific plot content here Here we need to vigorously praise our actors Their tension is not always perfect especially the performance of the actors which really conforms to their personal characteristics It can be said that all the audiences have been brought into the plot Since the story of the protagonist is made into a film his story must be very legendary The director s selection of the plot of the work can be said to be very accurate and the wonderful plot has been added to it It can be said that based on the great play space of the actor it also shows the unique personality charm of the protagonist which is a very wonderful effect for the audience,7
11 February 2011,Don't hesitate to see this.,I was your only friend You had one friend The Social Network is a very smart entertaining look at the founding of Facebook it s co creator Mark Zuckerberg and the various legal actions that have taken place over the creation and ownership of the company that has become the face of social life on the Internet I m sure that a lot of liberties have been taken with the story of what really happened if anyone actually knows but those liberties make for a very good movie The cast is great with Andrew Garfield Armie Hammer and Jesse Eisenberg standing out as the biggest and most important roles The writing and dialogue are very sharp and the cinematography especially in the initial setting at Harvard though filming didn t happen on the actual Harvard campus of course is memorable David Fincher did a great job cultivating a believable fascinating atmosphere from all the melodrama If you re wondering what could be so interesting about a Facebook movie I recommend that you do yourself a favor and see for yourself The Social Network is a movie that doesn t try to label its subjects as good or bad guys and it doesn t attempt to be a documentary showing exactly what happened It does however aim to entertain Aim and succeed,8
8 March 2011,"Fincher Proves He Can Make a Great Movie About Anything, Including Facebook",I had serious doubts when I heard there would be a movie based on the creation of popular social network Facebook What could possibly be interesting enough to devote an entire film to a website where people routinely post pictures of their meals play hundreds of crappy games and stalk each other s every move Well if there s one thing I should ve learned by now it s never doubt director David Fincher Fincher s immense talent coupled with the sharp writing of Aaron Sorkin combine to bring us one of the best films of 2010 Based on the biography The Accidental Billionaires the film tells the story of Mark Zuckerberg an antagonistic genius who finds inspiration in a drunken night of retaliatory hacking blogging and a subsequent pitch from classmates for a new social networking website He focuses his inspiration along with funding from his best and only really friend Eduardo Saverin creates Facebook and watches it explode in popularity across the world The story is framed within depositions for two lawsuits brought against Zuckerberg one from Saverin and the other from his classmates that accuse Zuckerberg of stealing their idea Fincher s movie is a slick fast paced story that immediately grabs your attention from the opening scene with Zuckerberg s high speed rant to his girlfriend over final clubs and standing out in a college full of geniuses Right away we know from his dismissive attitude and his arrogance that Zuckerberg is not a good guy and we see over the course of the next two hours how self centered he really is I d thought Jesse Eisenberg was great in ZOMBIELAND and he proves he s more than just the new Michael Cera with his excellence as Mark Zuckerberg He helps turn Zuckerberg into a complex character in the DVD commentary Fincher notes that it wasn t meant to be the breakup with his girlfriend that drove him to create Facebook as a means of impressing her showing her why she should be with him But to me that s exactly how the movie plays out Zuckerberg is hurt when his girlfriend leaves him and everything he does for the rest of the film is merely an attempt to regain her attention and show her what he s become THE SOCIAL NETWORK was my choice for Best Picture this past Oscar season and I was sad to see it lose Along with TOY STORY 3 this was one of the top movies of 2010 It came as a major surprise and it blew me away The cast was fantastic even Justin Timberlake continues to prove he has strength as a legitimate actor for further proof see BLACK SNAKE MOAN Andrew Garfield was great as Zuckerberg s former best friend Eduardo Saverin and I ll be curious to see how his career progresses after such a high profile film Finally we have Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross s award winning score for the film a sharp synthetic sound that feels at home in a Fincher film and gives it a familiar feel This film is wonderful how accurate it was to actual events I couldn t tell you As a story playing out on the big screen I loved it I m sure there are people out there who won t have an interest in seeing a movie about the creation of a social networking website but it s a lot more than that and I hope most people will give it a chance to surprise them as it had me,9
22 January 2011,Good Story and Informative,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,7
5 October 2010,Boring....,I didn t have much expectation when I was on my way to watch this movie and there wasn t much to be expected either This movie is boring and to me sounded more like a documentary but they tried to make it more interesting by adding drugs a few sexy looking young women and Justin Timberlake The movie was about how the Facebook came up and how the creator who seemed like a genius went through a rough time with law suits and lost a lot of friends in the process I gotta admit Mark Zuckerberg s character was well played but everything else was nothing special I would watch it if it was on TV or maybe on DVD rental but not worth my money especially with the price we pay to go to the theatres nowadays,4
28 October 2010,A culturally and socially important piece of work that is enthralling from beginning to end,If you were this columnist s webmaster you won t be too happy to hear this confession Instead of focusing on churning out a movie review he would be switching between windows to check on the latest news feed on Facebook How that affects work efficiency is one thing the other aspect of this six year old social network service is how it has taken over our lives The last he checked after writing the above paragraph nonetheless this single and January born hunt down his Facebook account to verify these facts columnist has 449 friends Why the constant need to refresh the Facebook page Mark Zuckerberg would understand at least that s how the Mark Zuckerberg in David Fincher s movie is portrayed Adapted from Ben Mezrich s non fiction book The Accidental Billionaires this drama chronicles the founding of the now famous social networking website Some seven years ago no one would have heard of Facebook until Mark Zuckerberg Eduardo Saverin and their team of technical experts came together to create this phenomenal online tool The story also involves a certain Napster co founder Sean Parker and a pair of Harvard twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss The 121 minute movie tells the story of how friendships were formed as well as how enemies were made in the founding of what may possibly be the most culturally and socially important networking website of our time Given the subject matter it is difficult not to dwell on the actualities of what happened in real life but Fincher Zodiac The Curious Case of Benjamin Button knows too well that he is making a movie for the masses Thus the resultant work is a crisply intelligent and emotionally engaging movie that further marks his place in the industry as an acclaimed filmmaker While it is important to note that none of the Facebook staff or employees was involved in the making of this movie you have to give credit to Aaron Sorkin s sharply written screenplay because it manages to keep the pace of the talky movie going Highly celebrated musicians Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross have also come together to compose a very hip electronica driven score to accompany the film The effective cinematography and editing by Jeff Cronenweth Kirk Baxtyer and Angus Wall also complement Fincher s clear cut filmmaking style The flashbacks are well executed and humour is evident in the characters dialogues Most importantly there is emotional punch as exemplified by the human connections and relationships which are built and torn apart in the story Ultimately it is a tale about how a man who manages to connect the world is a loner desperately trying to find his own connection Fincher s fresh cast of actors do a fine job of depicting their characters too Jesse Eisenberg Zombieland brings out the nonchalant brilliance of Mark Zuckerberg Andrew Garfield The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus exudes the will power of Eduardo Saverin and Justin Timberlake Shrek Foerver After personifies Sean Parker s slimy entrepreneurial spirit They are supported by other fine actors like Brenda Song Arnie Hammer Max Minghella and Rooney Mara This is clearly an ambitious project considering how worldwide viewers the 500 million Facebook users included will be anticipating the story of Facebook Like the website itself the movie is culturally and socially significant in contemporary cinema be ready to see the movie acknowledged for a job well done during awards season While this columnist is still at it he would recommend you to life MovieXclusive com on Facebook and if you must know as he ends off this review he has just added one more friend to his page making his total number of friends to 450 Now it s time to upload those photos he took at the party last night,9
6 January 2011,One of David Fincher's best,The Social Network was one of 2010 s best reviewed films It was considered one of the front runners for that year s Best Picture Oscar but ended up losing to the more conventional but not necessarily undeserving The King s Speech The film tells the story of the founding of the massively popular social networking site Facebook At the outset co founders Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield are best friends but business soon comes between them This results in legal action against Zuckerberg who is also being sued for allegedly stealing the idea for Facebook from his would be employers Aaron Sorkin s justifiably lauded script was adapted from Ben Meszrich s non fiction book The Accidental Billionaires Sorkin s dialogue is impeccable but the source material s questionable accuracy could be a problem for some There s little attempt to present multiple sides of the story and some of the plot points seem more like Hollywood fabrication particularly the ending That s not to say that the story isn t compelling but it may turn off some viewers with its selective embellished viewpoint From an acting standpoint the film contains a few standout performances Jesse Eisenberg deftly delivers his character s intricate dialogue but to me Andrew Garfield gives the film s best performance in the role of the betrayed friend Meanwhile Justin Timberlake surprises with a colourful portrayal of Napster founder Sean Parker Armie Hammer and Rooney Mara also stand out in supporting roles The ever dependable David Fincher s direction is expertly handled and the film boasts attractive cinematography and crisp editing throughout However the film s strong suit in the technical arena may be the music which was expertly handled by Trent Reznor Atticus Ross To be honest I wasn t a big fan of this movie the first time I saw it I got hung up on the script s veracity and it prevented me from appreciating some of the film s finer points Now I m more forgiving of the liberties taken with the facts and I can see that the film s craftsmanship is nothing short of exquisite In my opinion The Social Network is a must see and one of Fincher s best to date,8

13 November 2010,"A story about the founders of the social-networking website, Facebook.",David Fincher s The Social Network is a damn smart film A story about the founders of the social networking website Facebook is brought on screen with terrific dialogue direction and performances To be honest this is a brutally cunning flick it has Master Minds at their best who gone on to create a Social Networking phenomenal and proves how intelligent calculative and successful a Human Being can be The Social Network shows us the rise of Mark Zuckerberg The man behind the invention of Facebook and several other controversies Zuckerberg well I dunno how he is in Real Life but as a Cinematic Character he goes down as a legend Zuckerberg is a genius period Aaron Sorkin s Inspirational Screenplay is packed with terrific dialogue and gripping sequences David Ficher s direction like the film carries an attitude Jeff Cronenweth s Cinematography is bombastic Performance Wise Jesse Eisenberg delivers a solid performance as the ruthless genius Mark Zuckerberg He is in character in each and every scene Andrew Garfield is superb Justin Timberlake is remarkable He gets in your nerves and causes hatred that effective he is Brenda Song is first rate Rooney Mara is excellent Armie Hammer as Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss is flawless Max Minghella puts in a great cameo On the whole A Must Watch for the legend behind it I dunno know how much of what is shown in this blockbuster is true All I know is Facebook here I come,9
3 April 2018,ITS SUPPOSED TO BE BORING! BUT ITS A MASTERPIECE!,The moment I heard what this movie is about I was like I won t like it since I am more of an action adventure type of guy But boy was I wrong The fantastical story of the making of Facebook is just as intriguing as it is to browse the website itself Or maybe not so much nowadays But in any case this does not require you to like facebook to like this movie The movie is about friends and betrayals which center around a Billion Dollar Company I loved this masterpiece,10
15 April 2020,Friend Zone,2 unbelievably spellbinding hours The Social Network is one of the best films of the 2010 s A film emblematic of the cold cutthroat word of tech as we know it Unlike most biopics about influential people The Social Network does not portray Mark Zuckerberg as inspiring You could call him an antihero but that would suggest that the audience likes him enough to sympathize with him Zuckerberg is a villain A villain that won The Social Network tells a story of injustice with enough self awareness to know that despite the damning details it won t matter a wit Zuckerberg created Facebook and there s not a thing anyone can do about it In that sense there s an irony to the story It s a film about a social network built on the premise of friendship that was forged in a avalanche of broken friendships If that weren t enough Zuckerberg is seen here as an obnoxious sociopath The opposite of anyone to be friends with David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin were a match made in heaven It s Sorkin s most biting and cynical written work paired with the green gloomy visual realm that only Fincher is known for Jesse Eisenberg is Zuckerberg and it s the role of his career I don t know what it says about him that he can play this character so well One would hope he s nicer than this in person,10
15 January 2011,The Social Network invites you as a friend; accept it!,It s been the Internet sensation that you just could not avoid and it s now on at a cinema near you It isn t a feel good story but rather charts the rise of the website under Mark Zuckerberg and the recriminations his site creates Damaged relationships with his girlfriend best mate and original business colleagues make for a tale that feels more like something from Wall Street s investment bankers rather than the more personable stories of the web Filmed with the backbone being a set of parallel double lawsuits against Mark Zuckergerg the story of Mark and his site fills in the rest and quite a meaty story it is to Good acting with a cast that more than convinces in their roles dive us into this world Nobody is fully lovable but you won t feel repulsed Avoids over emotional baggage thankfully and concentrates on the amoral ambitious attitudes that are what is pushing everyone Filming is great as they avoid lots special effects or the like despite the techie nature of the film although there is a neat piece of CGI used for the twins in the film which you may not notice It s all about the story and the director has sunk his teeth into this one It s definitely an intelligent film and give it half a chance you will find it rewarding Poses many interesting questions and will have you milling over them even after the credits have rolled over,8
30 May 2014,Celebrating depravity,The movie tries to send a message that it does not matter if you are not loyal if you have no sense of morality what really matters is that you are famous and have billions of dollars People who made this movie tend to forget that it was not Mark zuckerberg s idea originally and try to twist that fact Apparently if u steal a idea and make billions of dollars nowadays you are considered genius I just have one question for Mark Zuckerberg If you haven t met the twins and Divya would you still have made Facebook First go and see Scent of a Woman everything Al pacino says at the end of movie seems to be against what The Social network represents but no worries Zuckerberg has got 500 million friends,1
19 July 2022,A Film about a man who betrayed his best friend.,If you still haven t heard of Facebook you must be living under a rock or in a cave There are currently 2 94 billion monthly active Facebook users making it one of the most used Internet websites I liked The Social Network for a few reasons and I disliked it for many reasons Based on fact the film tells the story of Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg s lawsuits not necessarily of Facebook as you might have thought Facebook started when a young Zuckerberg developed a simple computer program called FaceMatch whilst at college The program mocked and degraded women but it became a hit in college Impressed by his work Zuckerberg was approached by the Winklevoss twins to help them on a project Zuckerberg agreed to help them but weeks later after having worked on the project told them there were too many issues In the meantime he started Facebook The Winklevoss brothers then sued Zuckerberg for stealing their idea Did he indeed steal their idea or was Facebook entirely his own concept Ok what I liked about the film were the performances especially Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg and Andrew Garfield as his friend and Facebook co founder Eduardo Saverin All the female characters in the film were annoying Could this have been done intentionally judging by Zuckerberg s view of women with his FaceMatch program or were all the women in his life and his friends really all annoying Hard to tell Zuckerberg is depicted as a backstabber who can t be trusted and cannot be considered loyal and acted as if he believed he was better than everyone else The man betrayed his best friend and investor for goodness sake By the end of the film I didn t like the character and I can t remember rooting for him throughout the movie Not sure I m going to like the real Zuckerberg,4
9 September 2023,Facebook has a current valuation of $815 Billion,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,10
18 December 2014,The journey of Mark Zuckerberg's invention and establishment of Facebook,College is a time where every student defines him or her self It s when many people meet their spouse some of their closest friends and when they get the degree that turns into a career For Mark Zuckerberg Eisenberg his time at Harvard has been less about the classes and more about his time in front of a computer screen hacking into the school s database and blogging about his life We first see him infiltrating Harvard s student directory and creating a site where two students pictures are placed beside each other and viewers vote on who s hotter 22 000 page views and many outraged students later Zuckerberg is called into the school officials office and it is now that we see why he has very little friends The two friends he does have are Eduardo Saverin Garfield the finance genius and Dustin Moskovitz a computer programmer like Mark After witnessing the impressive computer work by Mark brothers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss meet with him and propose their idea a social website featuring student bios info and statuses and they want to call it The Harvard Connection Mark agrees that he s interested in helping the brothers and leaves About 6 weeks later a new social media site is activated featuring student bios info and statuses and it is called The Facebook The brothers find this new site and the conflict of whose site it is and who deserves the potentially billion dollar revenue is launched into action As an American teen that has been a Facebook account holder for about 5 years I was interested in this film Facebook revolutionized how our society meets and interacts with each other Coming into this film I knew two things 1 David Fincher Fight Club Se7en and Curious Case of Benjamin Button directs it so I knew that it would be well done 2 This was the big break for both Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield so I was curious to see what made their performances so good I thought that the actors were good in the film particularly in the case of Andrew Garfield The only other role I had seen him in was as Spiderman and this performance was far better I thought that Jesse Eisenberg did a great job of capturing the quick thinking and slightly smug Zuckerberg The story itself is true and the truth behind the history of this company is quite emotional This film was nominated for 8 Oscar categories and it won a trio of them Adapted Screenplay Film Editing and Original Score My one negative comment is something that I m still unsure of In the movie Mark comes off as very egotistical and pretty cutthroat I m not sure if this is what the real man is like or if Eisenberg s performance is what created this impression In the case of the former it disappoints me that one of the richest men in America is pompous and conceited The run time is exactly 2 hours but it seems longer than that While stereotypical college life and the lifestyles of the rich and famous do involve sexuality I found it to be a little too much for my taste I also found that the film leaves the viewer with the idea that tricking your business partners and friends out of a piece of the company that they helped you create leaves you rich However it does show the moral message that you can have billions of dollars but you may not have many friends whether in real life or on Facebook www sportsandcelluloid blogspot com,10
26 August 2022,Erica Albright (Rooney Mara),I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,10
10 October 2010,It's About the Girl,Ironically Facebook is all about the girl In the opening of Director David Fincher s The Social Network Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg gets dumped by his girlfriend BU student Erica Albright strong and spirited Rooney Mara and rightfully so Erica tells Mark that he may rationalize that he is getting dumped because he is a geek No It ll be because you re an a hole Outraged Mark bashes Erica on his blog and exacts his anger in the form of Facemash where Harvard students get to rate the hotness of coeds So the inception of Facebook was about Mark using his powers for evil not good Aaron Sorkin The West Wing brilliantly tells the story of the rise of Facebook and billionaire Mark Zuckerberg based on Ben Mezrich s The Accidental Billionaires Granted his screenplay is part urban legend and part real life drama about the social network Facebook which has 500 million members Zuckerberg has altered the world In the eyes and ears of Fincher and Sorkin is the great paradox The creator of The Social Network is an alienated genius predominately by his own doing Jesse Eisenberg deftly borders sympathetic misunderstood genius and world class a hole It may be safe to surmise that the real Zuckerberg lies somewhere between the extremes or perhaps not The Social Network is one the best movies of the year Whether The Social Network defines a generation Only time will tell The Social Network plays like Internet tragedy An ingenious idea captures the social consciousness and culminates in a multimillion dollar lawsuit pitting former friends against each other At the catharsis Mark s attorney Marylin Delphy compassionate and smart Rashida Jones tells him You re not an a hole You just try so hard to be one Thomas Hardy said character is fate Mark attained unimaginable wealth and success No doubt he has an amazing life In the final scene Fincher poignantly makes us wonder Is Mark really happy and complete Because Fincher and Sorkin make us care about this boy genius who would be king The Social Network is a warped rites of passage tale filled with deception and fascinating archetypes Mark Eisenberg goes into business with his loyal roommate Eduardo Saverin brilliant and earnest Andrew Garfield who actually finances Mark s brain child Mark s Facemash attracts the attention of the Winklevoss Twins Cameron and Tyler both played by Armie Hammer who are blond blue eyed blue blood scholar athletes Cameron and Tyler enlist Mark to develop their idea for a Harvard based on line social network Enter the seductive Sean Parker amazing Justin Timberlake co founder of Napster and the dark force that discerns Facebook as the next big thing Unlike Mark s other colleagues Sean gets that what makes Facebook work is that it is cool Timberlake is charismatic and dangerous he is becoming a powerful actor Sean wins over Mark with flash money and women He tells Mark This is our time Friendships end and unholy alliances form and in the end betrayal So the world may have been a lot different if Mark actually apologized to Erica Then again character is fate The Social Network is awesome and on some level very sad Sometimes the very genius that triumphs may ultimately be a curse The Social Network asks the poignant question Was it worth it On the surface this is a no brainer and we all have to live with our choices and the aftermath,10
28 July 2013,Overrated but still interesting,The internet has become a part of everyday life for most people and Facebook is something everyone has as least heard of and therefore the whole subject of this film is something most people could relate to Seeing how this well known site was started by college students was interesting particularly how it developed from one small thing and escalated The majority of the characters in this film are not at all appealing in the way that you would normally expect them to be However this is irrelevant because it is based on real people and as much as I did not like them I still wanted to carry on watching to see how it would develop I liked the way the story was told varying between the court cases and reflecting back on memories as this showed with an impact how the friendship between Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin was affected I was surprised how interesting a film about the origin of Facebook and the impact of its growth could be and I think it is definitely worth a watch,7
21 March 2011,"Worthy of all the praise, brilliant cast, great story, and just a terrific film",I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,10
19 January 2022,Lacks Passion And Becomes Repetitive,I found this to be a mediocre movie full of characters that all came across as losers despite having money and the good life Most of the characters are unlikable excluding Garfield s and I struggled to want to care about them The film didn t find any peaks or troughs,5
28 May 2011,Good ideas are in the universe',Admittedly I m the wrong demographic for this movie I find all the hoopla about it curious It s a good film absorbing and I loved its various messages but I was not blown away The film purports to be the story of Mark Zuckerberg and his founding of Facebook Like a lot of films based on a true story it takes some liberties Jesse Eisenberg does an excellent job as Zuckerberg portrayed here as a brilliant young man who likes to create computer programs When he creates Facebook he encounters legal problems and comes up against former friends I liked the points made in the film it s not the person who has the idea it s the person who takes the idea and makes it a commercial success who is rewarded The person we remember is the one who takes something and makes it a go The other point is when it comes to money everything else flies out the window That includes friendship and loyalty It shows us that business decisions are cut and dried bottom line events The acting is natural and low key and though this story could have been deadly it moves at a decent pace and at least kept me interested I was sort of expecting Citizen Kane and instead I got something several notches below That s the problem with seeing something after everyone else has seen it But I can certainly see its appeal to the younger generation,8
2 June 2020,An average film that was blown by publicity and some criticism.,Well this review is going to be hard to do at least for me Of course like anyone who was young in the past decade I also succumbed to Facebook s hypnosis and I still have an account on this social network but I confess that I haven t been there in months and I haven t spent much time there This spell that Facebook and all other social networks could have on me has long since lost its effect Today and I will be very honest in what I am going to say I see no reason to spend hours stuck to a social network putting likes on posts commenting or talking to other people Now let s talk about the film itself The film is not bad but it is far from being something I want to see again The plot addresses the process of creating and developing Facebook and the legal struggles that Mark Zuckerberg faced after that Directed by David Fincher it is quite weak in its task because as it happens a lot with films based on real facts it creates a new fictional story over real people I know this is cinema creative freedom is part of cinematographic art but as I said in a lot of other reviews there are logical limits to that freedom when dealing with real people and worse people who is still quite alive The cast has a lot of easily recognizable names and most have made a very positive effort However not everything went well The way the characters were thought was what most irritated me If some are stupid teenagers others are opportunists and there are still a lot of smart assholes There is virtually no character we can like and that blocked my interest in what I was seeing Thus we have Jesse Eisenberg in the shoes of Zuckerberg but in such a negative way and with so bad material that the character is inedible He is a complete jerk unable to capture the audience s sympathy Dakota Johnson Max Minghella Rooney Mara and Joseph Mazzello try to help however they have little to do once the film is delivered to Eisenberg On the positive side we have the good performances of Andrew Garfield who gave life to Facebook s first CFO as well as Justin Timberlake who was very good in his role too Armie Hammer surprises by giving life to twin brothers in an impressive and realistic way Winner of three Oscars Best Adapted Screenplay Best Editing Best Original Song it is technically a capable and decent film but not impressive It has regular cinematography sets and costumes and despite the prizes the soundtrack did not impress or attract my attention Honestly I don t even understand the visibility given to this film I don t think it justifies it and maybe it was very stimulated by advertising and the media convenient for the social network portrayed isn t it,5
14 July 2011,"don't use facebook, so I really didn't find this movie very interesting",First while there is some good dialog the movie s downfall is that it was too long at over 2 hours Also there isn t a lot that happens since it is just a film about the start up of facebook Mark Zuckerberg is portrayed as sort of a nerd genius but he is also a jerk with how he treats his one good friend Eduardo He basically tosses him aside once the hip outgoing Sean Parker shows up whom has connections to get facebook funded FINAL VERDICT I didn t think it was that great but I can see how a lot of people would find it entertaining Since I don t care anything about Facebook I say skip it,
28 December 2021,3,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,3
11 September 2011,A great film!...,I remember when this came out there was an awful lot of debate praise and general talking about it Unfortunately it never made it to my local cinema surprisingly but it finally made it to a pay TV channel this week I was quite keen to see it given the amount of attention it got and also because it was written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by David Fincher both of which I admire greatly Here s a little about the plot before I give you my thoughts After a disagreement with a girl Erica Albright computer genius Mark Zuckerberg goes online and writes a program called Facemash It was available only to students at Harvard University where he was studying It caused quite a stir when the University servers crashed He had the help of his friend Eduardo Saverin who would eventually be credited as a co founder of Facebook Moving on from this Mark is approached by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and their associate Divya Narendra to write a web site for them that had elements common with what Facebook would become Instead of working on their site Mark works on his own idea with backing from Eduardo Eventually The Facebook goes live at Harvard University and is an instant hit They expand to other Universities in the United States and eventually across the world Mark is contacted by Sean Parker the inventor of Napster and he eventually moves out to California to use his expertise All this time Eduardo is being squeezed out of the business It all comes to a head when Mark is sued by Eduardo the Winklevoss twins and Divya Narendra It is this action that forms the central part of the movie and it is from here the various parts of the story are told in flashback I ve probably said too much but the film is about so much more so I ll stop before the Spoiler Police Universities branch escort me off campus As you d expect from Aaron Sorkin an excellent script with some really great dialogue The film is beautifully made expertly paced and I found it very easy to get into Great performances all round particularly from Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg a real departure for him and he pulled it off brilliantly I must also give praise to Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin for me he put in the best performance maybe because his character was more likable but still a great performance Honourable mentions go to Armie Hammer as Cameron Winklevoss Tyler Winklevoss and Max Minghella as Divya Narendra I really enjoyed this film the subject matter is one that s close to many people s hearts and so I guess it was bound to be a hit I did find the picture very dark though so much so that curtains had to be drawn it was a daytime viewing I think it s one of those films that will eventually become a classic but it is one you have to watch It s very easy to get lost in the twists and turns of a piece of dialogue written by Aaron Sorkin I mean that in a nice way Over all beautifully made a great script an enthralling story and some great performances Recommended My Score 8 5 10 IMDb Score 8 0 10 based on 149 604 votes at the time of going to press Rotten Tomatoes Score 96 100 based on 272 reviews counted at the time of going to press,9
2 June 2020,Andrew Garfield is stunning,Wow this movie was good How did Garfield not win an oscar Dave fincher is one of my favorite directors maybe even my favorite Jesse Eisenberg is also fantastic in this What a movie,8
15 January 2011,Mesmerizing!,The Social Network is worth all the hype I expect it to do well at the Oscars Even though the movie is all dialog it sucks you in because the screenplay is well written by Aaron Sorkin I liked this film a lot cause I can relate to some of the characters and of course I have my own facebook page This movie is pretty much about the creation of Facebook and the people behind it The acting is very good especially by Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield Justin Timberlake isn t bad as most people expect him to be The newcomer Rooney Mara captures you in the few scenes she has Overall this is a perfect drama This should win at the Oscars I hope it does I rate this film 10 10,10
29 August 2012,An over exaggerated movie,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,6
3 January 2020,Mediocre,Mediocre for a David Fincher directed and Aaron Sorkin written movie,6
13 July 2012,pseudo intellectual,I hated this movie didn t even finish watching it because it just got on my nerves I think the purpose was to show Zuckerberg and other characters as genius greedy money obsessed and cold opportunistic people However it just looked kinda stupid all those intellectual duels they could have been fun if the characters had a bit more emotion but they just turn out boring and stupid nobody is like that in real life not even those goldman sachs people when they were being drilled in court behave in this way and they re as cold and money obsessed as it can be Mark is a nice relaxed guy come on give the kid a break stop trying to hard to make him a inhuman genius,3
11 May 2020,21st Century Gold,The Social Network 2010 8 10 I am really close to review this as a 9 10 The Social Network 2010 is a fantastic film I am a huge fan of David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin and this film fuels the admiration I have for them Fincher directs masterfully in this horrific biopic coupled with Sorkin s elegant dialogue Without Sorkin the film wouldn t work Without Fincher the film wouldn t work Two masters work together to create an amazing film I really would like to give this film a higher rating but there are a couple things holding me back In my opinion it lacks something spectacular Whether that be from the emotional detachment of the main character s or the fact that some scenes feel unneeded I think it misses something that could have made it perfect One scene in particular was very strange It involves a CG but not CG effect during a boat race When I look back on this scene in terms of the rest of the story it s really out of place the music choice is also quite strange Thinking about it more it s still very important for multiple reasons So it feels out of place yet deeply important very conflicting ideas Another issue I had and it s actually part of why I like the film is the pacing For the most part The Social Network 2010 is extremely fast paced Dialogue races by with each shot There are scenes that are short but sweet with excellent cutting But because it is so fast and complex you can get lost in what is happening Some of the most important scenes happen very fast and it s hard to digest analyze and remember everything This is also a positive for The Social Network 2010 The fact that you need to watch it multiple times to pick up on every little complexity is genius Sorkin is a master in that way This was the fourth time I watched the film and don t get me wrong I really love it I think it s one of the best biographical films that has been made and its message is just as powerful if not more powerful today The acting is exceptional especially from our leads Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield but there is quite a big emotional disconnect between this film and the audience at least for me anyways This is a result from our lead character Mark Zuckerberg played by Jesse Eisenberg who just isn t likable In fact he is the villain of this story rather one of them For the most part we re against him morally and legally The only likable character is Eduardo Saverin played by Andrew Garfield but he is the supporting character I could actually make an argument that he is the main character of the story and very well should be but I digress I think because of the choice to have only one hero who is a supporting character this film loses all the emotion it could have generated The moments where Garfield stands in the spotlight are highly emotional and I applaud his performance It was really rewarding to see Garfield s talent when a great director utilizes it I ve always believed that he is one of the most underrated actors of this generation and if more directors see his potential he could be one of the greats similar to Adam Driver Eisenberg is excellent in this film He perfectly portrays an unapologetic selfish jerk alongside Justin Timberlake Eisenberg is emotionless and fits Zuckerberg s character perfectly He is extremely detached from humanity and human emotion yet he makes founds social media phenomenon that strives for human connection It is so compelling and Eisenberg makes it so The cinematography of this film is stark detached and formulaic just like it should be The editing is fast paced but sacrifices slow emotional moments for orchestral dialogue The writing is exceptional and one of the reasons I want this film to be a 9 10 This film features one of the greatest scripts that was ever made David Fincher directs with meaning mastery and minimalism In the end I really think the biggest problem this film faces is emotion It tries desperately to conjure emotions albeit it is able to conjure negative ones very easily as seen with the very last scene of the film but fails to do so in the long run The Social Network 2010 is one of the greatest films released in the 21st century and is a must see for anybody that has ever heard the name Facebook,10
5 October 2010,"""The Social Network"" just might be the best film of 2010!",The Social Network tells the story of Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg who at this point is known to the world as the guy who invented or stole based on who you talk to Facebook The Social Network is an interesting take on the story as it doesn t really give any concrete evidence of whether or not Zuckerberg stole the idea for Facebook or had the idea all along and just needed the push from the Winklevoss s to get it going The movie not only focuses on Zuckerberg but also on the sites co founder Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield and Napster creator Sean Parker played by Justin Timberlake This movie while it doesn t feature any amazing special effects or any breathtaking animation it does feature the best acting I have seen in a film all year not to mention probably the only film that has a more interesting story than Inception Despite what people have been saying about 2010 being a bad year for movies I have to disagree I have given four films a solid 9 rating with The Social Network being the highest 9 of the bunch The story alone of Mark Zuckerberg is fascinating but there is just something about David Fincher s vision of this story that made this movie something out of the ordinary Maybe its the pure fact that Fincher decided to hire a cast of mainly unknowns to the mainstream film world to star in the movie I knew most of the actors before seeing the film but than again I am a film buff who loves independent film making Fincher made a bold move casting unknown leads to play in a film about Facebook because this could have caused the film to flop but not with Fincher He not only knows how to direct films but market them as well The cast as I mentioned above is superb Jesse Eisenberg may actually earn his first Oscar for his performance as Mark Zuckerberg The role seemed to be tailor made for him He seemed sincere and really fit the original Mark Zuckerberg s shoes Even the outfits he wore in the film were similar to those that the real Zuckerberg has wore I always been a fan of Eisenberg and always labeled him as an underrated and under appreciated actor He has had several solid roles before this film including Adventureland Squid and the Whale and Zombieland but Social Network will mark the film to put him on the map He hopefully will be featured in more roles now As for the other lead roles Andrew Garfield who is set to be the new Spider Man was terrific as Eduardo Saverin He was emotionally charged and just perfect in the role Timberlake was everything you expected him to be He played the smooth talking and ultra cool Sean Parker like a pro Its odd to see a film feature so many actors who seem so perfect for their roles I also have to give Rooney Mara a little bit of credit here While Mara wasn t in the film for very long she definitely makes a mark in this film Having met Mara in real life and seeing some of her other work I was wondering when she was going to be put in a film that would exhibit her talent The Social Network doesn t really feature much of Mara but gives her a chance to prove she deserves better than Nightmare on Elm Street and Tanner Hall I must give some credit to Aaron Sorkin who was the writer on the film Now remember folks this movie was based on a true story but also based on a book by Ben Mezrich Sorkin proves that he is not only a great writer but great at adapting a book to film Books to movie translations don t normally spell Oscar but in this case it does Sorkin s script was powerful interesting funny and thought provoking Fincher and Sorkin is a match made in heaven for the film world In the end The Social Network is hands down the best film of the year so far I definitely predict this film getting a lot of Oscar Buzz and being one of those films that will get a lot of nominations The film is a near perfect masterpiece It is brilliantly acted and the story is fascinating When you add Sorkin s witty sense of humor in with the amazing story and Fincher s vision and eye for excellent casting I don t think you could ask for a much better film The Social Network is the must see film of the year and should be seen by everyone This is probably one of those rare films that people from the ages of 15 to 85 could really appreciate MovieManMenzel s final rating for The Social Network is a high 9 out of 10 This is definitely the years must see film,9
29 October 2010,Brilliantly written!,The Social Network was a real fascinating and brilliant film It isn t just about facebook but more on the founder Mark Zuckerberg and how he created facebook and the process it went into In my opinion the critics got it right this film is one of the best of 2010 and no doubt should be nominated at the Oscars for best picture along with David Fincher for best director and Jesse Eisenberg for best lead actor Right from the start of the film it sets its tempo with the introduction scene The film is 2 hours but really didn t feel that long which is a good thing The film was vastly entertaining and not boring And the film is basically a drama about the creation of facebook which includes a lot of talking and the fact that it wasn t boring makes it even more remarkable One thing that makes the film great is the dialogue It was very well written and included clever and engaging dialogue Also what a liked about the film is that the story is told in a non linear fashion going back and forth to the start of Facebook and the lawsuits that followed That really kept the film fresh and keeps the viewers extremely interested throughout I just loved how Fincher did not warn the audience of the change in time He lets you figure that out via the dialogue and actions of the characters The editing was great and fit in well with the movie Overall the film was brilliant and shouldn t get missed,10
10 September 2019,Trout and Marlin,This is one of my favourite movies The direction and cinematography are so engrossing The dialogue is snappy and funny and satisfying The acting is just right in my opinion not too melodramatic not too subdued I m a big Jesse Eisenberg fan and he does a great job as the rude neurotic genius main character Garfield and Timberlake are good too The cuts between past and present ensure the film remains very well paced The atmosphere is comfy and the music is phenomenal Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross crafted such an unbelievable soundtrack that adds so much to every scene This movie wouldn t seem as intense or focused without the perfect memorable music I love this film and look forward to rewatching it many more times in the future,10
21 May 2018,"Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook, A Billion ""Friends"", And A Few Enemies",Of all the Internet social platforms that have ever existed Facebook is and unless something better comes alone will likely remain the best known Initially a platform conceived by Mark Zuckerberg on the campus of Harvard University in 2004 Facebook was then later expanded to other Boston area institutions of higher learning plus other Ivy League schools and then to Stanford Univeristy the latter which is not coincidentally located within driving distance of Silicon Valley Zuckerberg founded the site with roommates Eduardo Saverin Andrew McCollum Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes but as is the case with more than a few projects of this kind Zuckerberg s ego got the best of him and got him more than a few enemies in the process This great saga of the Internet became the subject of the 2010 film THE SOCIAL NETWORK Based on Ben Mezrich s book The Accidental Billionaires directed by David Fincher FIGHT CLUB and scripted by Aaron Sorkin of A FEW GOOD MEN and West Wing fame THE SOCIAL NETWORK stars Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg who along with his friend Severin Andrew Garfield Moskovitz Joseph Mazzello and Hughes Patrick Mapel came up with the social networking site that started life with a somewhat grotesque name called Facesnash Eisenberg later changes the name to Facebook via a suggestion made by high tech Silicon Valley hustler Sean Parker Justin Timberlake But those efforts come to enrage the Winklevoss Brothers Armie Hammer Josh Pence who had come up with the idea that may have inspired Zuckerberg s moves And then later other moves that Eisenberg makes on his own enrage the guys who helped him start it resulting in the young Internet genius getting himself into legal hot water And as we have seen of late it wouldn t exactly be the last time both Facebook and its creator would end up in hot water both legally and politically With numerous flashback and flash forward sequences detailing the rise of Facebook and the legal entanglements that Eisenberg must go through many of which were of his own making THE SOCIAL NETWORK is noted for a huge amount of expository dialogue that as is the case with more than a few films done from Sorkin s screenplays is delivered in rapid fire and often blackly comic fashion But the overall impression layered in with a great neo futuristic score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is one of a feeling of uber superiority on the part of Zuckerberg getting the best of him and in the process even as Facebook gains a billion plus friends as of 2018 making enemies for himself mostly unnecessarily And as is the case with films like 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY and WESTWORLD to name just two THE SOCIAL NETWORK is also about the rapid pace of technology outpacing our ability both to deal with it and not allow us to be thoroughly immersed in it Eisenberg does a good turn as the resident genius Mark Zuckerberg as do a lot of the other mostly younger actors in this epic film that will in the future be seen as a portrait of the world that was shaped in the first ten to twelve years of the 21st century,8
11 January 2011,Fincher Doing Facebook? He Makes It Work,Social Network The 2010 out of 4 Terrific look at Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg the man who would become the youngest billionaire due to him coming up with the idea for Facebook The film follows the creation of the website all the way up to the litigation s of two lawsuits from people claiming Zuckerberg either ripped off their idea or ripped them from money rightfully belonging to them I ll admit that I m not on Facebook and I knew very little of its history when going into the film I ll also admit that I found it strange when I first heard someone like Fincher would be doing a movie about a website but after viewing THE SOCIAL NETWORK is becomes so clear why the director would be interested in the material Zuckerberg is a terrific scumbag and one brilliant villain Perhaps not knowing the story of the people involved helped but I believe even if you do know the story then you ll still be blown away by this movie simply because of how masterfully directed it is and how brilliant Fincher tells the story and gets his words across with such simple ease The closing shots which I won t ruin say so much about the Zuckerberg and one could argue that these closing shots say more than anything leading up to the shots and I m sure these shots are more damning than anything you could read in a two thousand page biography Fincher has the ability to jump back and forth from various aspects of the story but the main focus is on how the website came to be and how Zuckerberg had assistance from his best friend Eduardo Andrew Garfield who would eventually sue him Seeing how brilliant their minds were would make some think that the story would lose you but instead the screenplay by Aaron Sorkin perfectly lays out everything that went into creating it and everything that could possibly cause it to crumble When you think about it it s really hard to come up with an interesting movie about a computer programmer but Fincher pulls it off because he structures it like a thriller and one can t help but feel as if they re being pulled into a dirty game with the villain willing to cut throats for his own ego Eisenberg is downright brilliant as the Facebook creator and what amazed me is that I m fairly certain the actor really isn t as smart or brilliant as the man he s playing yet he s still able to pull it off There wasn t a single frame in the film where I didn t believe he was this young genius but what impressed me most is how cold he could be with that stone face of his Buster Keaton was considered the great stone face of his era but I m sure he d even be impressed with what Eisenberg could do with the way he d simply look at another person Garfield is perfect as the other guy and Justin Timberlake continues to impress His performance as the seedy Sean is perfectly brought to life by the actor and no matter what you feel about his pop reputation you have to give him credit here The music score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross seems like something you d here in a horror film but it perfectly sets the mood and atmosphere here The cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth perfectly puts you in the film and the editing is exceptional as well THE SOCIAL NETWORK is winning a lot of awards and it s certainly easy to see why I think the majority of people were scratching their heads when they heard Fincher was doing a movie on Facebook because it just seemed unfilmable and uninteresting What he s done with the film is something extremely special and I m sure many decades from now people will be looking at this film to see the time capsule which was this social networking days,
16 January 2011,"One of the years best. Truly, a wonderful film.",I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,10
3 October 2010,"Facebook Story Earns a Definite ""Like""",I d heard of Facebook of course Who hasn t But it wasn t until just about two years ago that some college age friends of mine convinced me to set up my own page To tell you the truth I didn t think a whole lot about it Innovations on the Internet are proceeding at such a rapid pace that I can t keep up with most of it let alone all of it so the fact that Facebook existed really didn t make me think anything of it one way or another much less do any research into it And then I saw The Social Network Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg is a brilliant Harvard undergraduate in 2003 with far more intelligence than he has social skills After a brutal break up with his girlfriend Erica Rooney Mara Zuckerberg opts for some very public revenge He begins by posting some less than flattering blog entries about Erica and then in an all night flurry of programming he sets up a Website that features photos of female Harvard students where each can be rated for hotness These actions not only wound Erica but garner the attention of the Winkelvoss twins Armie Hammer with Josh Pence as a body double upon whose face Hammer s likeness is digitally imposed who have a Website idea of their own Zuckerberg meets with the Winklevosses or Winkle vi as he amusing terms them and their friend Divya Narenda Max Minghella to discuss doing programming work for them on an application they want to put together to enable girls to date Harvard guys But Zuckerberg thinks he can do something both broader and better and The Facebook is born With assistance from his friends Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield and Dustin Moskovitz Joseph Mazzell his idea takes off in a major way even as the Winklevoss twins are still trying to get him to do something anything for them The Facebook has such an impressive take off that it gets the attention of Napster s mastermind Sean Parker Justin Timberlake And once Parker and his marketing skills and ideas get involved Zuckerberg never looks back even though his few friends are being left further and further behind him The Social Network is based obviously on true events though those involved with the movie have never pretended that parts and pieces aren t dramatized for the big screen Zuckerberg insists that most of it is Written by Aaron Sorkin who was the driving force and writer behind one of what is in my opinion the best written television shows of all time The West Wing the dialogue is both witty and strangely natural when being voiced by the true computer nerds who are featured in the movie Eisenberg says his rapid fire lines so convincingly that I almost believe I was there when he loved lost and then won in a big way with his online creation The other cast members prove they are also well up to the task of bringing these real life people to movie life Though Eisenberg carries almost every scene on his shoulders he couldn t be as good as he is without the very able efforts of the supporting cast I d also point out that the one genuine special effect in the movie that of making Armie Hammer s face and voice an integral party to the body of Josh Pence is flawless and I was watching BOTTOM LINE The Social Network has already been touted as a potential Best Picture nominee come Oscar time I m not entirely convinced that the movie as a whole is quite up to that standard but I d be truly stunned if the screenplay wasn t nominated and I certainly wouldn t consider it undeserving if Eisenberg got a nod I m not always interested in recent American history after all I was there for some of it but I also found the behind the scenes look at the invention of a phenomenon to be fascinating And frankly even if computer applications or online interactions aren t your thing The Social Network remains a compelling expos of what has become a huge influence on relationships in today s society That it s entertaining amusing appalling and heart rending by turns is almost just icing on a very substantial cake POLITICAL NOTES There have been numerous privacy concerns related directly to Facebook In fact one of Zuckerberg s problems with his first hot ratings site which he called Facemash involved what school administrators termed a violation of the privacy of Harvard students Facebook has addressed some of the issues and continues to say it will correct or modify others It remains to be seen though just how much privacy some people will willingly forgo in exchange for the complete experience of what has become very much a real life social network FAMILY SUITABILITY The Social Network is rated PG13 for sexual content drug and alcohol use and language There are moments within the film where parents of younger teens may find themselves having to explain things they d rather not or where they could feel obligated to comment on things so their children don t think those actions are quite as cool or acceptable as they appear on screen The plot is also fast moving and scenes switch back and forth from several venues and viewpoints which makes the storyline relatively complex perhaps too much so for younger viewers I d recommend The Social Network for older teens 15 or 16 and up and adults,8

22 June 2012,Facebook: the heart in a heartless world,The great insight of David Fincher s brilliant The Social Network is that social inadequacy was the main driver of the Facebook juggernaut The film kicks off in 2003 with the nerdy OCDish Harvard student and future Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg meeting Erica Albright Rooney Mara for a date After Zuckerburg fails to impress with his rat a tat tat of facts and feelings think The Simpsons comic book guy mashed with Stephen Fry Erica torpedoes him with one of the film s many memorable lines You re going to go through life thinking that girls don t like you because you re a nerd And I want you to know from the bottom of my heart that that won t be true It ll be because you re an asshole Facemash via a couple of posh handsome Harvard twin brothers asking Zuckerberg to help them build a social networking site for students becomes Facebook or TheFacebook as it was originally known before the founder of Napster Sean Parker Justin Timberlake made his enormous contribution to the project Drop the the he tells Mark Makes it cleaner Initially a Harvard based info sharing site Facebook in Fincher s telling is born directly from a student s need to hook up with people in some fashion when so many of the traditional ways of doing so meeting in bars conversing face to face joining clubs are increasingly closed off to him In this way Fincher subtly yet profoundly captures what remains the lifeblood of the extraordinary Facebook phenomenon not social inadequacy per se but certainly social discombobulation Written by Aaron Sorkin of West Wing fame and directed by Fincher of Seven fame The Social Network focuses on the lawsuits filed against Zuckerberg in the mid and late 2000s With Facebook a household name and worth an estimated 25 billion Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire ever he was sued both by those posh twins who claimed that he stole the idea from them after they asked him to construct a social networking site and by his best friend and the original funder of the Facebook project Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield who is ruthlessly ousted by Zuckerberg as he gets closer to Parker the Napster maestro The Social Network taps into what has made Facebook so popular the desire to carve out an identity a life narrative at a time when it seems increasingly hard to do that through real social relationships in the real world People lived on farms and then in cities and now they will live on the internet says Parker He says it s no longer enough just to go to a party you must go to a party with a digital camera and share the photos on Facebook Everything from their job title to their interests their relationship status to their religious beliefs their social antics to their childrearing experiences gets recorded and logged by the FB generation as a kind of makeshift but also permanent personal narrative which tells everyone who they are and what they believe This is what is really significant about Facebook starting off as a university phenomenon before spreading to the rest of society At uni people s cultivation of a personal identity is necessarily a bit forced Lacking the social cachet that goes with having a certain kind of job living in a certain kind of neighbourhood and moving in certain kinds of adult social circles students instead physically sign up for societies or join clearly demarcated and often caricatured social networks the Rugby Drinkers the Political Club to demonstrate who they think they are Today in the absence of the old solidarities and the old informal networks of community and shared interests that is at a time of great alienation that experience of needing fairly self consciously to magic up an identity is repeated across society So a fundamentally student site now has half a billion members Facebook is better understood not as a country but as a refugee camp for people who feel today s lack of identity forging social experience The scene in which Zuckerberg tries to befriend or rather friend Erica on FB after their disastrous date and his pathetic apology where he keeps hitting the F5 refresh button to see if she has accepted is as painful a study of alienation as you are likely to see in the cinema this year An intelligent funny and humane exploration of society s new networks if I were on Facebook I d definitely Like this film,10
16 September 2010,"Fantastic Story, Drama, and Highly Entertaining!",I had an opportunity to see a free prescreener of The Social Network and I must say this film kept me on the edge of my seat the entire movie It is a movie that moves quick and keeps your mind alert and absorbing the information The acting is great all around the characters are pretty true to the real people It can be enjoyed by both geeks and regular people looking for an entertaining movie I really enjoyed this movie and will see it again and again when it comes out on DVD This is one of David Fincher s best films to date and that is a hard mark with having the great film library that he has So Highly Recommended a Near Perfect Film About Facebook,
28 February 2011,"""Almost"" There, But Not Yet.",I had a great pleasure of watching this movie almost everything about it was great It has got a brilliant script and dialogue spectacular director well acted group of young actors and though I can t really find the flaw in the movie there was something missing which kept this movie from being a classic Synopsis Base on the true story of the man who created Facebook com the world largest social networking website I love the story and how everything has been arrange out in the great sequences What really amazing was they managed to make movie with all talk so much fun from the beginning to the end There is no dull moment in The Social Network The movie is well pace and the script is absolutely brilliant I love the story but I also think it is the thing that kept it from being a classic the subject of the story is somehow to me not very deep hard to say but I think that is the word I was looking for Despite all the greatness the screenplay it s seem to lack depth and most character was all in the surface I wish I could feel more And also the fact that it was technology base movie it will get dated sometime in the near future Love the casting of this movie they all happen to look much smarter than their counterpart here than in real life Anyway the actors play their part well and it fitted the movie perfectly love the character The Winklevoss twin and Eduardo You got to give credit to Mr Fincher for casting Mr Timberlake and turn him into an OK actor here Now that was a lot of work Who can question the ability of Mr Fincher and his technique of movie making This man seems to know what he is doing Anyway what really standout in this movie is the editing and how they unfold and mix present with past in the movie really well without getting distracted The score also fit the sequences well Final Words I enjoy watching is movie through and through Love the pace the fact that they concentrated on friendship part rather than on the legal term And I will definitely adding this to my DVD collection Recommendation Not for everyone but if you do enjoy well written fast pace drama this might be for you Reason to Watch Get the chance to see the life of the world youngest millionaire Reason Not to Not Fincher best work Rating 8 10 Grade A,8
14 November 2010,The Social Network That Ruined A Friendship,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,8

17 January 2011,"""You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies"" - Tagline for ""The Social Network""",OK by now everyone on planet Earth has heard about the social networking phenomenon that is Facebook launched in 2004 by co founder Mark Zuckerberg in his dorm room at Harvard University By now no doubt we ve read the stories about how it came to be and how Zuckerberg has since become one of the youngest if not the youngest billionaires in the world What we haven t seen is a movie that highly dramatizes Facebook s founding for entertainment and educational purposes So here is The Social Network I have a Facebook account let s just get that out there Want to friend me Send me an e mail How many people at IMDb don t have Facebook accounts Come on be honest shoot me a private message and we ll talk about it OK back to the movie Director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin working from Ben Mezrich s highly embellished novel The Accidental Billionaires have created an outstanding film a film that masterfully captures an era and the revolutionary young tech genius behind it all as well as the friends and colleagues he either intentionally or unintentionally alienated as a result of Facebook s mammoth unprecedented success The problem with movies that define a generation like Rebel without a Cause The Graduate American Graffitti The Breakfast Club etc is that they are very much products of that time They capture what it was like at that time in this case the era of social networking By that very fact alone the picture will become dated some time down the line The Social Network will undoubtedly be added to that list as well as many more But it s still fun to live in the moment It is suggested that in the film which opens in 2003 Harvard University sophomore Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg may have created FaceMash Facebook s early predecessor because of a nasty break up with his then girlfriend Erica Albright Rooney Mara to get girls and elevate his status on campus The online traffic from FaceMash crashes part of Harvard s server and he is put on six month academic probation as a result Nonetheless others are impressed He is thus recruited by wealthy seniors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss played by Armie Hammer and body doubled by Josh Pence and their business partner Divya Narenda Max Minghella to help create a social networking website for them as their programmer Now this is where things start to get sketchy This inspires Zuckerberg to start his own social networking website called Thefacebook which will be exclusive to Harvard University students Using the financing of his best friend Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield and recruiting roommates Dustin Moskovitz Joseph Mazzello and Chris Hughes Patrick Mapel Thefacebook is soon up running and has gone beyond Harvard s borders to many other prestigious college campuses around the U S and quickly around the world This doesn t impress the Winklevoss s and Narenda who soon cry foul and allege that Zuckerberg stole their idea for a social networking website Another wrinkle in the scheme of things is file sharing website Napster co founder Sean Parker Justin Timberlake whose shady personal and professional exploits are well known to anyone old enough to remember Napster I certainly do He has soon worked his way into Zuckerberg and Saverin s inner circle and is now giving them financial and marketing advice and he eventually became Facebook s first president which doesn t sit well with Eduardo since he views Parker as a threat both to Facebook and his friendship with Zuckerberg Intertwined with their rising success is what happened afterward with Zuckerberg giving depositions in two different lawsuits one with the Winklevosses and the other with Eduardo The rest is history The Social Network is a phenomenal film a film that perfectly captures an era thus my earlier assertion that it s a period piece that defined a generation the Facebook generation Also even though Facebook s founding is a classic tale of unlikely success as are most American success stories The Social Network is not a purely American film No it s a universal film Hence Facebook s appeal to people all over the world online membership only recently surpassed the 600 million user mark at least to people in those countries that will allow online access to it And not only that Facebook has become a culture all on its own You can t go anywhere online anymore without seeing a Like button connected to Facebook or a link offering you the choice of posting a web page to your Facebook Wall Or you can t be in a college classroom or high school classroom for that matter without watching others or doing so yourself logging into their Facebook accounts updating their statuses with witty lines like In class so bored or I d rather be stabbing myself in the eyeballs with a pair of rusty scissors than listen to his her nagging voice go on and on Facebook is also highly addictive It s almost like a drug Perhaps when you re first starting out you just can t get enough of it You re on it all day night If anything the success of The Social Network with both critics and at the box office and more recently the Golden Globes has brought in more users who just want to see what all the hoopla is about The film might as well have been a two hour advertising campaign in that regard Having been a Facebook user for three and a half years now I can see that this movie was an event movie in the making and an event movie that lived up to the event it depicted and perfectly captured a slice of an era You can say all you want about Zuckerberg and his back room dealings in getting Facebook started I just don t know the guy but you can t deny its impact and this film s deserved success in showcasing a modern phenomenon that s likely to continue for a very long time Facebook is Zuckerberg s baby and like any newborn it s still just in its infancy 10 10,10
6 January 2017,For better and worse this movie represents America.,Was everything in the movie 100 accurate to what actually happened Almost certainly not Did that stop the filmmakers from taking basic facts about the situation and turning it into a riveting piece of new era drama Absolutely not For better and worse this movie represents America The ability to create free enterprise the internet without having a dollar to your name you can use these things to make yourself a millionaire But we all know being a millionaire isn t cool anymore What is also inherently American is to take someone else s idea and improve upon it with or without their consent Though what follows will likely be a lawsuit another American tradition From a filmmaking standpoint the story was told incredibly well by one of the greatest screenwriters of his generation Aaron Sorkin using the legal proceedings as the wraparound for the plot from start to finish was a clever device that intrigued and enlightened without being a distraction The score by first time screen musician and long time Nine Inch Nails member Trent Reznor and his tandem composer Atticus Ross was probably the best thing to happen to this film Without the score it isn t the same movie it provides a somber tone that gives the movie it s unsettling feel You could make the point that the movie also embodied another American ideal greed Although Zuckerberg didn t seem to care much about money in the film and apparently in real life the corporate greed of the lawyers during the takeover as well that of the way Sean Parker was portrayed seemed to leave a heavy footprint But in the end Rashida Jones character was right Paying everyone who was rightfully owed a piece of the pie was nothing more than a speeding ticket At the time of writing this Mark Zuckerberg has a net worth of 49 7 Billion making him the eighth richest person in the world and no amount that was given away could even be remotely considered as significant to that sum,6
3 October 2010,The Price of Success,Well I certainly wasn t all that excited about The Social Network when I first heard about it A movie about a Web site that was founded by an obnoxious twenty something sounds awful on paper Even the dynamic duo of director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin didn t generate all that much enthusiasm from yours truly But three phenomenal trailers later and I couldn t wait to see this film It helped that early reviews compared it to Citizen Kane and The Godfather among other all time greats So does it live up to the hype The short answer is YES It s a very compelling film about the time in which we live and a man who impacted our time greatly He s not the most pleasant hero but his story makes for two incredible hours of cinema and all those involved should be proud While this film certainly is more than just the Facebook movie it still is first and foremost about the founding of the irritatingly inescapable social networking site In 2003 Harvard student and computer whiz Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg was dumped by his girlfriend Erica Rooney Mara an event that ended up changing the Internet and turning Zuckerberg into a billionaire But that certainly didn t happen overnight After his breakup with Erica Mark went home and drowned his sorrows online writing some demeaning blog posts about his now ex girlfriend and creating a site called Facemash which asked users to choose the hotter of two female Harvard students The site crashed the Harvard network almost instantly and attracted the attention of the Winklevoss twins Cameron and Tyler Armie Hammer popular and athletic twin brothers who are looking for a programmer to create a site they came up with The Harvard Connection which will allow Harvard students to connect with one another on the Internet Zuckerberg agrees to work with them but instead he goes to his best friend Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield with a similar idea The Facebook Essentially it s like MySpace but exclusive Only students with a Harvard e mail address will be able to use it Once launched The Facebook becomes a hit Everyone at Harvard is using about it and Mark and Eduardo are the most talked about students on campus Once The Facebook expands it attracts the attention of Sean Parker Justin Timberlake party boy extraordinaire and founder of Napster Sean wants this project to succeed but his ideas drive a rift between Mark and Eduardo This rift eventually becomes permanent and the latter sues the former who is also facing a lawsuit from the twins he screwed over years ago I ve always been a big fan of Aaron Sorkin s fast smart dialogue The man knows how to grab your attention with his words and his work here might just be better than anything he has ever done But even more than the exceptional dialogue the way he crafts his story is just masterful The Social Network is so many things that giving it a label is almost impossible It s a drama a coming of age character study an examination of entrepreneurship and the things that often get tossed aside in the endless quest for more and a look at who we are as a society in the digital age This film succeeds because of a number of things but in my opinion number one on that list would be Aaron Sorkin Mark Zuckerberg is an absolute fascinating character played brilliantly by Jesse Eisenberg I really didn t think the young actor capable of a performance like this but he s great This is a man who is completely driven but he s not driven as to make money as one might expect Instead the currency he seeks is status And while he obtains a kind of superficial acceptance thanks to Parker he never gets what he desperately wants In fact everything he does moves him further and further away from true acceptance Eisenberg pulls of all the complex layers of Zuckerberg exquisitely He s a fighter energized at the prospect of finally being cool But by the end of the film he seems exhausted just being him almost as if he knows he has defeated himself I think this will be the defining performance of Eisenberg s career as he is another big reason the film succeeds I also think he s a shoo in for an Oscar nomination Eisenberg s costars are uniformly excellent especially Andrew Garfield He has a scene near the end of the film in which he confronts his former best friend and he s just dynamite It s what gives the film an emotional pull the proceedings until that point were for the most part a little distant In this scene things become clearer and we recognize Eduardo as this story s tragic hero and Mark and Sean as its villains though again credit Eisenberg for making Mark a somewhat sympathetic villain This scene just might land Garfield who s taking the reins from Tobey Maguire in the Spider Man franchise an Oscar nomination and he just might be there on Oscar night with none other than Justin Timberlake who s got just the right amount of charm to make Sean Parker tolerable to watch He s a scoundrel no doubt but Timberlake makes him a magnetic presence on screen There will be those who debate the veracity of events in The Social Network as filmgoers debate the truth behind any film that s based on real events What can t be debated is this film s expert craftsmanship Sorkin and Fincher with the help of a handful of perfectly cast actors craft a tale that works on a number of different levels It tells the story of a conflicted and fascinating young man while also outlining the rise of perhaps THE company of the Internet age and showing us what an obsession with social status can drive us to do It doesn t matter if you use Facebook or not The Social Network will sweep you up completely from beginning to end,10
4 October 2010,Thought Provoking,How about a movie without sex violence or even a kiss How about a movie that is thought provoking inspiring smartly written directed and staged How about a movie where a relatively minor character is a scene stealer and a person to remember I m referring to the Dean and his scene with the V boys This guy was spot on as was everyone else including Justin Timberlake who I always thought was a flake I totally enjoyed this movie and it is only the second movie this year that I would recommend the other being Inception I guess I m not cool though don t have that first billion yet David Fincher is one of my favorite Directors and has created a totally unique and intriguing concept for the movie as he always does Aaron Sorkin s script is amazing and together the two have created a classic movie bereft of the usual movie junk and have told the story which seems as real as could possibly be from Zuckerberg s mind,10
17 October 2010,The morality tale for the 21st century we've all been waiting for.,It s not hard to imagine that a biopic of the creation of facebook a project that isn t even complete as its rise to world domination continues unabated could be monumentally bad For a start all of the characters in the movie are real alive and known litigation junkies In fact the structure of the film is built around litigation What s more it s set in geek land and it s populated by America s landed money generation a class of kids who are not exactly imbued with likability Add to that the layer of egotism of successful entrepreneurs that has to be applied if this is going to be a true reflection of the situation And early on the movie dwell on a scene where the two key characters get off on the creation of an algorithm in a Harvard dorm and we re in a place that has to be bad does it not Well actually no it doesn t in fact I can t recall a biopic with such historical realism that betters this magnificent creation David Fincher is a director of some impact Fight Club and se7en to name but two of his grisliest creations typically hit you hard from the off and keep on hitting Not the sort of director you d expect to be behind a successful exploration of coding in the Ivy League s finest Halls of residence But what Fincher does is dial back the excess and zone in on a cast of young people that somehow creates a magnificent and fully fleshed ensemble whilst giving Jesse Eissenberg the star vehicle that at its core it has to be His portrayal of Mark Zuckenberg has to be seen to be believed And believe me you ll believe it This is direction and acting of the highest calibre The establishing scene of Eissenberg in a College Union bar being dumped by his lifetime love Erica Albright played gently and beautifully by Rooney Mara is jaw droppingly good for three reasons the camera work subtle and gorgeous throughout especially the tilt shift effect later in the movie in England s Henley the dialogue well what did you expect Aaron Sorkin wrote the script and the acting And that s it We re off and running for nearly two hours where the action never stops for a second and yet not a swear word is heard no fights no sex no nudity no special effects so how can this be an action movie And yet it is it s hilarious but there are no gags no slapstick and it makes you think from start to finish Because what Fincher and Sorkin have achieved is a morality tale for our time not with the big crass in your faceness that Wall Street revels in but in the intellectual ethics of IP Wherever you look in the movie you re challenged to think who was right and who was wrong IP changes hands and evolves at such a dizzying speed that one wonders was it the germ of the idea or its evolution that created Facebook s value Was Napster creator and serial entrepreneur Sean Parker slyly played by Justin Trousersnake a bandwagon jumping opportunist or the real creator of Zuckerberg s ultimate wealth Was Zuckerberg an impressionable but lovable innocent or a self centred traitor to his only friend Eduardo Severin also played sympathetically and at times the axis of the movie by Andrew Garfeild Was Severin a philanthropist or a pariah and were the Winklevosses I lied there are special effects in this movie real I particularly liked the fact that Sorkin and Fincher avoided the temptation to rip into these ridiculous stereotypes and in so doing and gave them at least a shred of dignity by the film s end Oh did I mention the stunning soundtrack by Trent Reznor NIN Well if I didn t I should have because I m going to buy the CD as soon as I ve finished this review This is a very good film indeed It most certainly justifies a ten rating and I urge you to see it,10
14 October 2010,Ironic Biopic of a Social Outcast Capturing the Zeitgeist of Online Social Connection,This propulsive 2010 film is probably the most conspicuous case of product placement in recent Hollywood memory Director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin prove to be a particularly effective team in bringing to vivid life the somewhat trite story of the betrayal behind a Web site that reshaped the chore of networking into the zeitgeist of the online community reaching 500 million participants The irony is that the movie is not really about the Facebook phenomenon itself but its opaque creator nineteen year old Mark Zuckerberg a socially impervious Harvard based hacker extraordinaire whom the creators would have you believe developed Facebook as a way to get back at the girl who dumps him and the elitists who reject him However Sorkin is far too shrewd to turn this into a simple revenge story Instead he uses these factors as catalysts in his inspiration to ignite the basic need we have to judge other people in the safe haven of a site populated by people who are otherwise socially disconnected The story s framing device centers around the detailed depositions given in two concurrent lawsuits against Zuckerberg one filed by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss identical twins and star members of Harvard s rowing team along with their business partner Divya Narendra and the other filed by Eduardo Saverin Zuckerberg s former best friend The Winklevoss twins filed a suit claiming they originated the idea for Facebook when Zuckerberg agreed to help them build a Harvard only community site The second suit cuts deeper in that Saverin a Facebook co founder finds his ownership in the company cut from a third to one tenth of one percent The decision is not without merit since Saverin s singular determination in eliciting advertisers to the site did nothing to help the site gain popularity At the same time it reflected Zuckerberg s socially inert nature whether true or not showing he is incapable of maintaining a deep friendship not out of malice or greed but because he has the unrelenting fortitude to recognize he has a better idea to code and implement despite the personal consequences It s a fascinating conundrum that requires Fincher s emotionally precise direction to make it work effectively In a tough role Jesse Eisenberg Adventureland plays Zuckerberg close to the vest by showing sparks of humanity with measured acuity It s a well observed performance that relies on keeping a clear distance from the viewer Justin Timberlake does well in the showy supporting role of Napster co founder Sean Parker a savvy paranoid poseur whose bona fide sleaziness provides the impetus Facebook needs to turn it into a global phenomenon However it s Andrew Garfield who gives the movie the little heart it has as Saverin simply because we feel his devastation in missing a once in anyone s lifetime opportunity by trusting a friend whom he thought had his back There are sharp near cameo turns by Douglas Urbanski Inside Job as Harvard president Larry Summers contemptuously arrogant in his dismissal of the Winklevoss plea for support in their case against Zuckerberg Rooney Mara who makes her character s numbing rejection of Zuckerberg palpable and Rashida Jones I Love You Man as a junior defense attorney who provides Zuckerberg the only honest summation of his legal chances to win Fincher has made an intentionally cool often detached film compounded by a jarring Trent Reznor Atticus Ross score but the hope of making a real honest connection always seem to be within reach,8
18 July 2020,Smart and Witty!,Fincher knows what he s doing This biography was nothing short of compelling smart with quick conversation The story was easy to understand with the links between characters the unfolding of the plot and the purpose of The Social Network And this is coming from a guy who doesn t even have Facebook The casting was superb Jesse Eisenberg delivers an Oscar worthy performance unfortunately to come up short with an Oscar His smart diction and quick witted acting brings the person of Zuckerberg to life Quite the portrayal With notable portrayals by Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake the characters of this story came to life on the screen and the life of Harvard college students was shown in a very clear way An easy to understand film which hooks the viewer from the start The Social Network proves itself to be one of the classics of the new decade Absolutely a must watch one of Fincher s finest if I do say so myself,9
11 May 2023,The next time you use a certain social media platform think of this film.,Clever biographical story of the origins of social media domain Facebook and its founder Mark Zuckerberg However this film shows that there were other people involved in its rapid formation from the US university dorms of some computer geeks Facebook has been a phenomenon The events of this film only begin in 2004 and within the space of two years there were one million users Money grabbing investors and shares and lawsuits prevailed as this film shows Director David Fincher Gone Girl works well with a clever script to tell the story If I have one criticism it is that the geeks shown all speak at what seems like a million words per second What seems to have quite a boring synopsis turns out to be very good and one of the best films in 2010,8
4 January 2011,Didn't know Facebook had such an evil yet an intelligent brain as a back-end....,Talk about social networking and one thing that pops up in our head first is none other than the famous site Facebook Who on earth wouldn t be interested in knowing the story behind the famous social networking websites of all time So Mark Zuckerberg is officially awesome I was glad that the movie was being directed by none other than Fincher I was excited beyond limit when I discovered that it was a David Fincher project the guy behind such amazing movies like Zodiac The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and my all time favourite The Game His previous mind boggling movies surely speaks of his virtue As a director David Fincher has taken some of the brilliant stories of all times and metamorphosed them into the finest flicks created ever in the history of movies and The Social network happens to be one of them Albeit Mark Zuckerberg in reality wasn t at all approached for the project and wasn t entailed anyhow in the flick the movie was manifested as a series of events as they occurred altogether with the assistance of Eduardo Saverin in real life Each event was put down to the flick with the assistance offered by Eduardo and Boy the story of facebook is interesting must I say The evolution of how the ideas arose from Facemash to TheFacebook and eventually Facebook is really surprising and wonderful as well The story began with Mark Zuckerberg s Jesse Eisenberg s girlfriend breaking up with him thus causing him to dirty blog about her to soothe his agonized heart Taking it too far he compares her face to every girl in the Harvard and thus develops a website named FaceMash which had the feature of comparing who s hotter which eventually brought down Harvard s network The creation of FaceMash in one night brought him in the eyes of the twin Winklevoss brethren Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss played by Armie Hammer well that barely seemed like a single character and their business partner Divya Narendra Max Minghella who gave Mark an idea about a new project of theirs Harvard Connection website asking him to be their programmer The main story begins when Zuckerberg gets his head to build a website named theFacebook without caring to look back at the Winklevoss brothers and in the long run dumping his best friend Eduardo Savarin convincingly played by Andrew Garfield as well as Sean Parker Justin Timberlake the co founder of Napster The character Eduardo Savarin is well portrayed by Garfield who brings in the real sensitive part of the flick Justin Timberlake has become more of an actor now and he did his bit in the flick very convincingly As Sean Parker he suggests Mark Zuckerberg to drop the the from theFacebook which clearly expounds why the whole world knows the website by the name of Facebook alone The plot is very intricate and full of surprises as you would see Zuckerberg playing around with his friends turning them into foes while Eduardo s geniality is well exploited in the flick by Mark There are instances in the movie that clearly depicts how much dedicated Mark Zuckerberg was to his website with more than 10 14 hours of coding everyday while some showed him making fun of the jury and the Winklevoss brothers of their ignorance while one hilarious moment showed him stunning a teacher by his answers in the midst of his departure from the classroom The movie is simply awesome I didn t find anything wrong with the movie and I hope to see David Fincher s next as soon as it gets released I d recommend everyone to just go for it,8
6 October 2010,You'd better pay attention,The Social Network is a film full of special moments moments where we are treated to footage that will become classic and many will be studying and discussing in the near future learning how to find ways to pay tribute and possibly imitate the artistry of some very talented people particularly Mr Fincher a man who has already given us plenty to discuss and keeps delivering some spectacular work The Social Network comes very close to being perfect almost flawless and with the exception of two key scenes where ironically the stylized language and an arguable casting choice become blemishes on an otherwise beautiful and stirring film Earlier on The Ghost Writer combined all the elements and deliver a film that showed the maturity and growth of one of the masters of cinema and to be fair to Fincher this is a vast improvement over Benjamin Button a film that appeared a bit detached at times and that might have been much too gorgeous for its own good forgetting to add the right amount of emotion in a film that need to be if anything an explosion of passion and the celebration of love and life There were plenty of sparks but the climax failed to come This is not the case here The Social Network has moments of devastating emotional power It moves us because it gives exactly an opportunity to see how success happens how the various elements must be in place and how talent passion and the desire to eliminate the competition takes you all the way to the top The main character lashes out at one attorney and makes it clear to him and us that it all depends on focused and driven you must be on what is really worth it and this makes all the difference The Social Network shows the best and worst of humanity an expose of what supposedly happened when one of the biggest Internet enterprises was designed and set up It is admirable to see how the different players are given an opportunity to present their perspectives It s scary and heartbreaking at times and there are moments when we shudder at the realization of what we can be capable of doing of how far we are willing to push the boundaries to get what we want The Social Network has several spectacular performances a joy to behold and admire given the young age of most of its cast Their work is impressive because they are relative newcomers and yet they seem to understand their characters and the material that inspired the film In particular Garfield s acting is nothing short of wondrous and perfect not surprising since he had an spectacular turn early in his career in Boy A a film that shook your soul mostly because of the way Garfield realized his character In The Social Network it is reactive performance that highlights the essence of the tragic relationship as he finally understands what he is dealing with It is a classic moment of such powerful repressed surprise and fury we can only gasp The Social Network is not to be missed because much like The Ghost Writer earlier on gives a rich and satisfying experience not a bag of tricks where fx tend to overshadow brilliant ideas Fincher explores once again the darkness of the soul and this time his work is not as graphic and violent as he showed in Seven and The Fight Club true masterpieces on their own right but it s the fresh and innocent look in the face of academia and what might be hiding there that shocks us because the film is not truly about business enterprises but about how one eventually has to make a choice between what is right and wrong and I think if only we paid attention,9
2 May 2020,The simple story turned into an extraordinary film.,Intelligent funny and energetic The Social Network is a spectacular film that David Fincher flawlessly crafts This is probably the only film that I ve given 10 stars and the film is just dialogue The film is exciting with each line of dialogue Jessie Eisenberg portrays Mark Zuckerberg as a smart witty and hilarious man who begins making his network without knowing how much money this network would make The music is used cleverly and the editing is constantly extraordinary Andrew Garfield also is wonderful and he gives an extraordinary performance near the end The film is two hours and it never feels slow I could even watch another half an hour of the film It never is uneventful It keeps your adrenaline pumping They are able to tell a story that offers more than just dialogue David Fincher directed this film with much care and I appreciate him for that I hope I can watch more of his films soon I have only seen Seven and this film Overall The Social Network works and it takes a simple ordinary story and makes it better than any other film,10
6 April 2011,"The Social Network (2010) - A Tale of Friendship, Loyalty, Greed, & Betrayal",The Social Network takes us back to the time when Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg creates the social networking of Facebook and the consequences that follow But even though one of the movie s supporting details is the Facebook creation there s actually a real plot behind that It s about the presentation of everyday society and how the Facebook s creation tears everything apart The many consequences of society include friendship greed loyalty and betrayal These lessons of life are brought together into a movie that represents today s society and that s what I like to see Every single moment in this movie was written brilliantly directed brilliantly casted brilliantly and everything brilliant was involved Aaron Sorkin wrote a powerful memoir of everyday society and David Fincher used his clever mind to bring it all together Fincher s directing gave the film a certain style unlike his previous work He wanted the viewer to dig deep into a world where it can sometimes not be a bright place He used the creation of Facebook to represent not only how social media has affected our world today but how certain real life events such as greed and betrayal can be involved in the process Aaron Sorkin s script is filled with well written dialogue shared between the characters clever and unexpected twists interesting side info and terrific depth The movie is also accompanied by a haunting score that helps guide the audience through the story the fast paced editing used to go back and forth on Facebook s creation and it s aftermath showing it s cause and effect theory and the performances are some of the best cinema has ever seen From Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin the trustful co founder to Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker Napster founder that joins Facebook to make it more edgier But it s Jesse Eisenberg s Oscar nominated scene stealing performance as Mark Zuckerberg himself that definitely carries the movie His fast paced usage of the dialogue helps give the script a lot more attention to detail and keeps the viewer along for the ride If one is expecting to watch a biopic on Facebook they d better not think that much of that They should really see this movie while knowing it s actually a modern representation of today s society with Facebook s creation at it s core The Social Network is David Fincher s best film since Fight Club and it s one of my all time favorites The Social Network in my review Expertly written acted and directed a master class,10
22 October 2010,Critics got it right...,It s nice to see that the critics hadn t blown this movie hugely out of proportion like they did to the last film I saw in theaters cough Scott Pilgrim vs the World The Social Network with a 98 on RottenTomatoes is my second favorite film of the year thus far number one being Inception Kudos to David Fincher and Jesse Eisenberg and the rest of the cast for bestowing us with some the most compelling characters I ve seen in what seems like an eternity as well as a clear cut drama without being too vague or melodramatic I honestly didn t believe at first that a great film could be derived from a topic involving Facebook but there you go Anyway most of the film isn t about Facebook at all but rather the people in the told events What do I recommend Give it a shot is it a ground breaking film like the Matrix No but still there is entertainment and intellectualism to be found here although I felt it featured more of the latter rather than the former I must say though if you don t no much about business politics you may be out of luck Keeping that in mind however go SEE THIS FILM,9
4 January 2022,Really Terrible movie,This movie is about the worst types of Human Beings made by the worst types of Human Beings It may be entertaining to watch but the story is about how a person screws over another group of individuals for personal gain with 0 consequences Now that person is one of the richest people in the world while the people that helped have nothing to show for their input and hard work It made me sick to to watch and even sicker to know that we as Americans encouraged and enabled this type of behavior An episode from Star Trek Original Series called Mirror Mirror is the perfect example of the type of work structure within facebook They will stab you in the back so they can take your job and move one step up in the corporate ladder,1
4 October 2010,"Ah, the ironies",Terrific hatchet job story of Mark Zuckerberg genius oddball killer competitive greedfreak and perhaps Asperger afflicted founder of Facebook Whether I agree about the value of Facebook is not relevant to the worth of this film as it is one of the best high tech film stories of the new millennium and revolves around what is now just so critical to many millions of people around the world internet social networking OMG Even though his mother may have overdone it with endless be sure to close your mouth admonitions in his youth you ll see Jesse Eisenberg was fantastic as the mind in his head maybe inventor of internet social networking but probably not as shown Zuckerberg as was Andrew Garfield playing Eduardo Saverin his his best friend and co founder maybe not as brainy but way more emotionally healthy The rest of the cast was equally good even Justin Timberlake was terrific but with his outsized ego in full speed mode I am not sure he was acting as Sean Parker the cocky inventor of Napster and world class devious manipulator This story sadly but powerfully showed so well that youthful vigor uber creative ideas killer competitive juices and premier business connections and execution will always be the best allies to selling out all previously held moral ethical principles for the sake of humongous bucks and great fame But that said the massive in your face ironies of the story were what was most interesting by far Zuckerberg as shown was not social at all but wanted desperately to create a social network He also initially didn t care a bit about being rich but he is now America s youngest billionaire ever He also didn t think advertising was cool on Facebook and was initially repulsed by it but now his resistance ethics are well past totally sold out and Facebook makes billions every year in advertising and rivals Google as the net s biggest ad bank How many more personal ironies could the filmmaker have shown about Zuckerberg And can they all be that true Thus the story candidly displayed how easily and quickly one s honorable intentions can get left far behind when big money and fame arrives on the doorstep in truckloads It also showed that even lifelong best friends and business partners are not safe when big success comes calling in its mask of many faces See this perhaps best film of the year and learn some great net business startup savvy and pitfalls but try not to get sucked into the money making end of it At least try for a minute or two to make your mom happy,8
17 August 2016,"Mark Zuckerberg, NSA Agent and Actor",Facebook is not some creation of a smart kid its a NSA CIA operation to track every facet of your life and was written and coded by US special services they got ZioZuck to front the company and know use it as a psychological warfare operation against the masses Look at ZioZuck destroying Europe by going after those that tell the truth about the organized invasion of Europe by young hostile men who bring no women so the demographics is seriously threatened he has an agenda and that is to enslave us in the Matrix this move is nothing more than fantasy to cover for a man who is a front agent for intelligence agencies Immediately after Facebook made it big Weibo and VKontakt of the Russian Federation and China were released the GRU and Chinese Intel know exactly what Facebook is,1
22 January 2011,"THE SOCIAL NETWORK (David Fincher, 2010) ***1/2",When I first heard of this I was wary of both the subject matter the creation of the Internet fad that is Facebook and the fact that a director of Fincher s status would lend his services to such an intrinsically geeky venture Since it has been sweeping the boards all through the current awards season I had to take notice and opted to check it out prior to Oscar night having passed the film by during its initial theatrical run locally To be honest it took me some time to warm up to the film given its essentially intractable nature similar to PI 1998 and PRIMER 2004 in this regard it is best approached as a conspiracy thriller with the intricacies of the dual lawsuit raised against Mark Zuckerberg proving undeniably gripping The film is clearly dialogue driven with some key scenes irritatingly taking place in noisy surroundings but the script emerges a surprisingly witty one besides it is most effectively scored in part by Nine Inch Nails Trent Reznor being appropriately capped by The Beatles Baby You re A Rich Man I have one quibble though I doubt young Americans today ever really bother mentioning the likes of Teddy Roosevelt Irving Berlin or Cole Porter in their daily conversation or that the hotshot behind the Napster application cared where THE TOWERING INFERNO 1974 was shot incidentally it was odd for pop star Justin Timberlake to play someone who has had such a ruinous effect on the music industry Moreover I do not agree with those who feel Zuckerberg was a scoundrel the way he is played by Jesse Eisenberg he seems more gullible than opportunistic and especially powerful as a character defining moment for him is the poignant finale By the way the fact that one especially somebody so young can amass billions simply for having brought the world closer together as it were imparts Capitalist Divine implications that are profoundly disturbing and which perhaps one sensibly ought not to ponder too much on,8
2 October 2010,See This If You See Only One Movie This Year!,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,10
10 October 2010,"This movie is nothing if not worthy of a watch thanks to strong direction, dazzling performances, and a smart script.",I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,10
18 October 2019,Masterpiece.,An incredible confluence of talent subject a movie that captures our current American cultural moment better than any other Eisenberg absolutely kills it playing an obnoxiously aloof ego centric sociopath who is as monstrous as he is sad a proto internet troll with limitless boundaries It s low key one of the funniest movies of the decade delightfully evil the Sorkin dialogue is rapid fire genius All this ignoring the stunning technique editing music cinematography general tone,10

7 May 2012,not a masterpiece but fairly entertaining,Let me start out by saying I am not a big fan of face book so when I picked up this film i was not sure what to expect I personally think this film could have done a little better but it still managed to keep me interested for most of the movie The acting is excellent the storyline is slightly stale but still pretty good This film is flawed on many levels but still manages to maintain my interest For a film on face book I found myself pleasantly surprised Personally I think this film is is a bit overrated but is still fairly decent entertainment Even people who don t like face book should give it a watch Still not a bad film 7 10,7
24 August 2019,I know most of it isn't real but I don't judge it by that,This is the peak for Jesse Eisenburg Andrew Garfield JT Amazing dialogue and score Most of the shots were good and the directing was well done I guess my problem comes down to personal preference I don t like the fact that they talk so fast and without subtitles I couldn t have watched it But still this movie is a masterpiece,9
4 January 2011,A smart .... intellectual movie,Social Networking was an outstanding very much engrossing movie which keeps you thinking every sec of the film The film starts on a heated discussion between Mark Zuckerberg and his girlfriend which eventually leads to their break up In the fist of anger computer programming genius sits down that night and creates a website facesmash com to take revenge on his e girlfriend The website creates miracle overnight among the Harvard students and faculties This makes Mark a note of talent and is immediately contacted by the twin brothers who wants Mark to create similar social networking website where friends could meet and update their individual status What follows next is the inception of Facebook and how Mark fights with his own friends Social Netwrok is kind of blink a miss film The movie will keep make you think on your feet It will keep you on the edge of your seat It is hard to imagine any one else apart from Jesse Eisenberg essaying the role the youngest billionaire He is simply outstanding and gets in the skin of the character The direction by David Fincher is flawless He is growing better with each films So overall I loved the film Definitely watchable more than once,8

24 October 2010,Strong drama with sharp Fincher and Eisenberg,Based on the novel by Ben Mezrich and the real life occurrences of the foundation of Facebook David Fincher s critically acclaimed film markets the trials and tribulations of the world s biggest social network site The film revolves around how Mark Zuckerberg played brilliantly by Jesse Eisenberg who is a social misfit and yet a technical mastermind After berating his girlfriend and getting himself dumped he takes his fury out by posting blogs and creating a website which matches women from surrounding colleges and naming it Facemash allowing users to vote who is more attractive out of their classmates An uproar ensues and soon Zuckerberg is targeted by Harvard students to design a website from them In and amongst all the animosity of court cases social and friend rivalry we see a great story jump from past to present in a calm fashion that grabs you full attention thanks to the styling of director David Fincher and the unfazed exploits of Zuckerberg s actions against anyone Whether you love Facebook or hate it there is minimal doubt that how it all came about from a bitter spat with a partner is intriguing The weaving legal terms are fascinating and the amount of detail encoded about the formulas and constructing is great Eisenberg after his impressive comedy outings in Zombieland etc has created the perfect enemy that you can somehow route for whilst being intellectually unmatched throughout Despite the serious predicament he finds himself in the character can often come up trumps with a killer comedy line One very good note to take from this film is that Andrew Garfield will be a great Spider man Playing Zuckerberg s best friend Eduardo he is slick funny and carries the burden of being the victim in the bigger scenes the final showdown at the Facebook office is a very strong scene The film has a few flaws For one a showdown between Eduardo and girlfriend Christy about why he hasn t changed his Facebook status to in a relationship makes the whole principle of the site seem ridiculous Justin Timberlake is hard to take seriously and occasionally there are lapses in repetition as if the same thing had been discussed before Nevertheless this has proved a special surprise This is a good strong drama with great leading performances and an unmatched drama by David Fincher to create possible Oscar nominations for next year Worth checking out,8
2 October 2010,How many synonyms are there for incredible?,How can a movie about the creation of Facebook and the legal battles that followed it be interesting enough to warrant a two hour film When you attach talents to the project like David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin the question is how could this movie not be interesting enough to warrant a two hour film From the dark and elegant mind of David Fincher the genius behind movies like Fight Club Seven and Zodiac and the intelligent writing ability of Aaron Sorkin the creator writer of the multiple Emmy award winning series The West Wing comes The Social Network It chronicles the creation of the most popular social networking site in the world Facebook The word facebook should mean something to anybody who owns a computer I have a Facebook Most of my family has a Facebook grandparents included and I could count on one hand the amount of friends I have that don t have Facebooks But this innovative and extraordinarily convenient social tool that we take for granted nowadays has a twisted and surprisingly corrupted past And this past all stems from the manipulative mind of a man named Mark Zuckerberg In the opening scene we are also introduced to our protagonist of the story Mark Zuckerberg This character is where the greatest risk of the film occurs Normally when the protagonist does not fit the role of good guy hero character he or she is the antihero who is not an entirely good person yet still retains their likability Zuckerberg breaks this role He is not at all a likable guy in the beginning of the film He s a genius who doesn t know how to handle it Zuckberger displays a glaring disposition where he sets himself above everyone else intellectually He is extremely pretentious and arrogant towards his piers and colleagues who he views as all inferior to his extreme level of intelligence The character reminds me a lot of Jason Schwartzman s role in Wes Anderson s Rushmore only not being as much of a caricature so much as a human being not to say that Rushmore isn t a great film The way we see the character of Mark Zuckerberg who I will say is excellently portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg evolve is incredibly intriguing and constructed very well After the opening scene we are cleverly guided through this story of betrayal and deceit which never loses its charisma I give huge kudos to this film for its consistency The dialouge never slows down or trails off and the film as a whole consistently hits a high mark for me I was never bored never disinterested and never lost I ve brought up getting lost or confused multiple times because this film does deal with so much intellectual computer and legal jargon that it could have potentially been extremely confusing to anyone who doesn t have an understanding of the world of coding or lawsuits including me Fortunatley Sorkin writes in such a convincing and clear cut way that as long as you pay attention you will understand what is going on and you will understand the meaning behind everything that happens in this film and how it all builds to the end in a fulfilling way Everything about the script is incredible and downright intoxicating I found myself practically in a trance during long stretches of fast paced conversation There was never a single moment in this film where I felt unsatisfied with what I was viewing As the film progresses it still retains its gripping story and witty dialouge but it begins to morph into a story that goes far beyond just the creation of Facebook It deals greatly with corporate greed and the lengths that one can go to achieve something so incredible but lose so much in the process The subtext of this film is where it doubles in its intrigue and makes it all the more impressive and memorable It also is a film which defines this generation where technology is part of daily life in the social world The film presents the pros and cons to this new age of social interaction yet is not overbearing on one side or the other The Social Network is in essence what every film should be something that is incredibly well made while also having a socially relevant credibility and worth Hypothetically The Social Network is perfect Even fantastic dialouge like this will have to be backed up by great audio visual work that matches the compelling nature of the script The Social Network plentifully succeeds on this level as well Fincher has an impressive talent of creating very gripping visuals even without immaculate and elegant artistic backdrops He can create a dank and disgusting basement into a bloody and brutal fighting ring or a plain and boring deserted desert road into a perfect scene for the final showdown between detective and serial killer Fincher succeeds once again as he turns a college party something we ve seen a million and one renditions of into something so intelligently and artistically crafted in it s own razor edged contemporary fashion that we forget what kind of simplistic scene we are in He can turn a slow and monotone boat race into something so beautiful and delicate The combined talent of Fincher and Sorkin is thankfully not a wasted one in The Social Network It lacks in no area and while it succeeds above and beyond in its script this is far from the only good thing about the film Everything comes together so well in this film and it works like clockwork The Social Network is a film which defines a generation of technology and connecting through its vast network of social capabilities It is done so incredibly well and means so much that it is a definite must see,9
3 December 2020,Possibly the most interesting biography film ever.,This film was su interesting The storyline is while quite simple but executed in such a complex way of difficult storytelling it made it one of the best written thrillers I loved the storyline Some say it was too fictionalised and dramatised but for the sake of entertainment and intriguing film I say it s more than worth it The only thing which surprisingly was disappponting is how short it was It s 2h long which is fine yet when it ended I felt that I wish that it lasted for longer I wanted to see more of it,9
28 April 2020,weak performance,The story is weak and not worth making a movie about it The plot was boring throughout,3
10 January 2011,Not a very pleasant movie,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,7
6 October 2010,Even the chicken looks good,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,9
2 October 2010,Undecided,I have mixed emotions about this movie I can t say that it was bad It was well written well directed and the acting was much better than I expected I can t zero in on any huge flaws in that respect However I didn t find it entertaining Interesting yes but I was bored There is no one to root for All of the characters are assholes and douche bags so it makes it hard to care while watching the movie I take that back I liked Rashida Jones character but her role was too small for that to matter A random tidbit Justin Timberlake s performance was great I didn t like his character but he was definitely a scene stealer I liked that the previews did not reveal who he was The reveal was a bit of a wow moment,7
18 September 2022,Aaron Sorkin!,The Social Network is a masterclass in effective writing It is rare that a script perfectly illustrates the tone of a story just with words The script is elevated by excellent casting for the specific roles Quick witted and purposeful every line is delivered effortlessly by Jesse Eisenberg I have never felt such strong emotion from an emotionless character before The cast is excellent the score is poignant and the directing is top notch but what makes this a perfect film The writing Additional Note If Aaron Sorkin is attached to any film I will watch it because of this movie and script,10
28 December 2010,Who want's to know the Facebook?,I can t recall seeing a modern Biopic which was so much talked about than The Social Network In this age where the contemporary community and media cannot live without the word FACEBOOK it s always a pleasure and interesting to see how its creators have really made it The picture full of Mark Zuckerberg and his life after 2003 is experienced not so quietly throughout the movie The story telling is done via bouncing in between two law suits Starting from the early days of Marks Harvard life up to where the Facebook hits a million subscribers the events which occur are dramatically represented without making the viewer bored Some dialogs slip away without giving a split second to comprehend due to the talking nature of Mark which sounds speedier than a F1 racing car Coz of this maybe a second viewing is recommended But the story is pretty neat and easy to digest Specially as many of us already know what really went in the creation of Facebook The important fact is to the get the line between fact and fiction correct Especially when it s based on true events and the key character is immensely influencing the society as we speak So you movie gores better read a few articles once your done enjoying the movie Movies are always pretty dramatic than real life so you may need to realize that one way or the other Cinematically The Social Network is a good movie You won t get bored and the story does not let you down Its fast as I mentioned before so you might be left out from time to time but catching up is mandatory Acting is wonderful I believe Jesse Eisenberg have done justice to his character and hope that Mark Zuckerberg will agree on that If not we have never seeing the real man and will end up engraving someone else s image on our mind Overall what started with an investment of 1000 and becomes 65 Billion worth within years in the plot doesn t sound like a bad movie at all And that s Facebook,8
23 August 2013,Well Made Film On A Totally Unimportant Subject,I must confess I m not a fan of Facebook I have a registered account featuring some photos of my travels and previous work place and that s about it I don t have any friends on my page and have no interest in adding anyone and I m totally perplexed why so many sane intelligent people spend so much time treating it as some sort of yardstick for real life success as in Oh I ve got 439 friends on Facebook therefore my life is much better than someone with less friends while at the same time feeling bitter towards people with more friends FFS get a life Have I mentioned I m not a fan of Facebook This film based on Ben Mezrich s book on the founding of the website and the personal and legal ramifications that came with it shouldn t in theory hold much appeal to me as a potentially hostile audience member but I gave it a chance For the most part it is an engaging and involving drama perhaps more so than I expected Mark Zuckerberg sets up a website called The Facebook featuring illumine at his University and the more the network expands the more he finds himself becoming more unpopular with erstwhile friends It should be remembered that most of what the film entails is nothing more than rich American students taking the huff with one another but director David Fincher keeps everything vaguely compelling Much is this is down to the score by Trent Raznor and the soundtrack did remind of Clint Mansell s music for REQUIM OF A DREAM one of my favourite soundtracks Where the film is less successful is the rather overwrought manner in what is at stake Again let s be honest it s not like the fate of the Universe is one the line and despite what many people might think it s not like Zuckerberg has genuinely changed the world As it stands THE SOCIAL NETWORK is a well made drama but not much more than that,7
4 October 2010,Wait for it on DVD,The Social Network is a decent enough movie to waste a couple hours watching with a couple friends The lead actor sorry I forget his name already did a very good job I also liked him in the other movies I ve seen him in The movie s just okay and boring at times hey what do you expect from a movie that is entirely about the guys who invented a social networking website but it s much better than I feared it would be and totally worth seeing No reason you need to see it on the big screen though I d say catch something else that s more fun and rent this down the road on DVD or catch it on pay per view or whatever worth seeing but nothing special The acting s pretty good even Justin Timberlake is okay though he is obviously the weakest link of the actors in this but at times the story drags and they talk about stuff that wouldn t interest most people The movie s also a bit too long Worth a watch,5
15 October 2010,"Movie about me, movie about you, movie about us",The simple fact that you are reading this review now is a valid point that we feel strong connection to the main subjects included in The Social Network What are those subjects Pursuit of fame glory money recognition and of course on lining on a daily basic I believe that those are reasons that drove Mr Zuckerberg great break out role for Jessie Eisenberg and his accomplices also great Justin Timberlake among others during they journey of making now famous social network system called face book There are few quite amazing thinks about this film First of all I must praise it for very good pacing The whole thing runs for about 2hrs and it is assembled from scenes of arguing discussing things etc yet you will not find any dull moment in the story Also what I found worth pointing out is that even though this film is filled with high tech slang you will always be interested in what is happening on screen even if you are just mildly aware of the possibilities that your good old PC provides So to sum it up The Social Network is very timely and at the same time very universal story about friendships betrayals youth and all stupidity that comes with it and of course about face book where as a matter of fact this slight review will be submitted,8
21 September 2010,"Intelligent, organized, efficient: the way Zuckerberg would do it.",I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,8
21 September 2020,David Fincher at his best,David Fincher at his best amazing direction amazing cast and a wonderful soundtrack The Social Network is showing us not just the create of facebook but the gap between the society and the harsh unreliable life of business Of course don t forget the amazing IT life and the hope that everyone can be very rich within it,10
29 January 2011,The Social Nutwing,The evidence is clear that Mark Zuckerberg as portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg could be the poster child for ADHD meds treatment Was there MORE to this film I thought Yes indeed The Social Network became more complex and interesting when it got beyond the initial geeky clutter The individuals who played significant roles in MZ s life and work make the facebook creation story pretty amazing Yes he is an a hole but the movie isn t just about him From his ex girlfriend played by Rooney Mara to the Harvard faculty early fb investors and the MZ fb groupies this IS a remarkable story To wit I think Justin Timberlake did a superb acting job as the developer of Napster as he portrays the greedy self centered Silicon Valley dude with obnoxious aplomb His involvement in facebook s development hilariously brings out the cheesy side of Zuckerberg Good stuff The Social Network watched in its entirety proves worthwhile And of course David Fincher is an excellent director who makes sense and order of the many elements that resulted in the ever controversial social media menace known as facebook,5

25 February 2011,"Hypnotic, important and unmissable",This late in the game David Fincher s The Social Network needs no real introduction or proper synopsis It is a dramatized debatably truthful version of how Facebook was created by Harvard dropout Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg juxtaposed with two lawsuits with people involved in its creation When I first saw the film in October my feelings were immediately uncertain I thought it was good but not great and was left with the same emptiness many people have continued to complain about since the film s release After having re watched the film a second time knowing full well what the experience was going to be akin to not only do I feel The Social Network is an excellent piece of celluloid but also the most important film of the year and the current decade The fact that Fincher and writer Aaron Sorkin were able to craft such an intense and wild ride out of something as mundane as HTML coding and alleged idea theft speaks volumes for their creativity and suggests that not every silly idea for a film will turn out as bad as it initially sounds Had Fincher s name not been attached to the credits it would be insanely difficult to even consider this be the work of the same man who gave us Fight Club Se7en and the Oscar winning The Curious Case of Benjamin Button But looking closer you will immediately notice his calling cards the frantically paced hyper kinetic editing style his films have been well known for alongside his meticulous sense of detail While we already knew he was a master in both realms his work in The Social Network only helps cement what a talent he has so quickly become Every scene is just so incredibly constructed that it manages to haunt and hypnotize you at the same time And whereas indulgence and length bogged down Zodiac and practically destroyed anything Benjamin Button had going for it it is nice to see Fincher scaling back and maintaining brevity I had no idea he still had The film would be nothing however without Sorkin s incredible screenplay While he may have been adapting Ben Mezrick s The Accidental Billionaires Sorkin still manages to inject an almost outlandish dose of creativity and originality and allows the project to become his own The quick and witty quips between characters the poetic voiceovers the heartbreaking diatribes the film is very much driven by dialogue and the written word and what easily could have a by the numbers adaptation becomes something so much more Just watching the opening of the film and seeing the rapidly devolving argument between Eisenberg and Rooney Mara playing Zuckerberg s then girlfriend Erica Albright is enough to suggest any naysayers of the project were all so very very wrong After the debacle of the underrated Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and the incredibly disappointing Charlie Wilson s War it was great to see Sorkin bounce back with such an incredible and unforgettable screenplay While everything else practically works secondary to the work of Fincher and Sorkin especially Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross score they all complement each other to help make the film the experience it truly is Eisenberg is startling as Zuckerberg managing to be hilarious frightening and scared all at once He maintains all of his emotions at every turn and gives his best work since his brilliant turn in The Squid and the Whale Andrew Garfield maintains a deer caught in headlights look for the majority of the film but it works for his portrayal of the wounded and betrayed best friend Smaller turns from Rooney Joseph Mazzello Max Minghella Justin Timberlake and especially Armie Hammer are all equally well portrayed and delivered While they are not exactly unknowns their lower key status among Hollywood powerhouses helps give an even greater sense of authenticity to the film But the film s raw and unhinged power comes squarely from how timely the project is We scoffed at the idea of a Facebook movie but it really is the most important major motion picture of last year and will likely remain one of the most important of the next decade It stands out in a year dominated by 1980s nostalgia sequels prequels remakes and throwbacks as something so wildly original and indefinable The film s target audience of young adults and 20 somethings have lived and breathed Facebook for years But Facebook is almost the McGuffin in this case because the film is not so much about the creation of the social networking website as much as it is about the attitudes of the people who created it Sure there are debates about the authenticity and factual elements in the film but anyone would be doubting themselves if they did not recognize how very real the jealousy the selfishness the bitterness and resentfulness and the all for one attitude of these characters are in our current times Journalists and writers have been saying for years how attitudes are have been shifting and the sense of entitlement the younger generation and its peers maintain While films have come and gone trying to quantify these assessments and try to define the internet bred generation I feel The Social Network is the first to truly get it right to truly define this generation The liberal and embellished changes were made for dramatic effect but they make the project that much more real and hard hitting I saw myself being reflected back in these characters and its hypnotic appeal makes the proceedings that much more terrifying I enjoyed but did not adore The Social Network the first time I saw it But I think with every fresh re watch the film will get better each time It truly is one hell of a movie and one that will continue to grow with its importance We laughed at the idea of a movie about Facebook but with how important it has become to just about everyone in their day to day lives we should have never had any doubts 9 10,9
31 October 2010,Love the enigmatic disjointed time sequence format by the way,The advertising of David Fincher s latest film misleadingly introduces a nagging expository sermon on the interlinking worlds of business and cyberspace however the film itself heartily agrees with the audience that the aforementioned notions have been tiresomely overdone and instead leads gives them a rousing good time venturing into the thrillingly vibrant lives of several colourful characters It satisfyingly turns down the obvious option of trying to be deeply moving and meaningful a hapless endeavour that would inevitably produce another unbearable saccharine bore in favour of using the opportunity to let us relish the scandalous immorality behind Facebook s creation while it remains safely on the other side of the screen Computer enthusiast Mark Zuckerberg brilliantly portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg is the clever audacious youth miles ahead of the rest who coolly weaves a hazardous tangled web of crafty manipulative feats throughout the film With a razor sharp tongue and an unwavering confidence that some may find overbearing although others may think it justified given his intellectual superiority he casually and entertainingly parades about the world wielding his remarkable capabilities in a very Holmes like fashion Along the way Mark has a brush with a pair of brawny hot tempered male twins both played by Armie Hammer who at least provided the inspiration for creating the internet giant and end up suing him for what they belief was the theft of their intellectual property He also makes ill fated dealings with fellow networking entrepreneur Sean Parker a surprisingly well cast Justin Timberlake who effortlessly influences Mark and the audience with his rebellious charm and exciting ideas to secure a share of the company Sean too carries a sense of fun and upbeat charisma as a movie character harmless in our world of reality Superbly written by Aaron Sorkin to whom we have a great many pricelessly witty dialogue pieces to thank for The Social Network is mostly a slick stylish glamorous and highly entertaining medley of ambitious backstabbing teenagers who are also understandably human but the incorporation of their emotions is kept to a very sensible minimum The more depressing scenes towards the end and the characters of Mark s loyal friend Eduardo Andrew Garfield gentle ex girlfriend Erica Albright Rooney Mara and kindly lawyer Marilyn Delpy Rashida Jones manage to provide all of the sentimentality that is needed or wanted here,8
1 October 2010,Just a speeding ticket.,Rarely does a film come along that poses important issues and ideas about what it means to live as a human being Even more rare is a film that truly gets to the issues at hand what is happening to us right now in these modern times The Social Network is such a rare film Everyone with a computer knows about Facebook In less than five years it has gone on to become the latest and most fashionable way to keep in touch with people you either know don t know or would secretly like to know It is the ultimate source of knowledge about people whoever doing whatever whenever Because this is such a permeating idea the decision to release the film only six years after the website was launched is indeed brilliant Then again so is the film itself With a film based on computer programming and website building in order for the vast majority of people to be drawn in the screenplay must be exceptional Aaron Sorkin s is such Each and every character has that unique brand of speaking he has used in dozens of scripts the dialogue is suave and intelligent the delivery is snide and sarcastic There is so much talking crammed into this two hour film that most people will be amazed they sat through a film like so Yet with the acting and directing this is hardly a chore In the acting department all are sublime and elegant in their respective performances From Armie Hammer as the Winklevoss twins to Andrew Garfield as co founder Eduardo Saverin not one actor misses a beat or step Everyone is remarkably on track in keeping within the confines of the story Of course the characters with the most face time are the ones everyone will remember and everyone needs to remember Justin Timberlake and Jesse Eisenberg come Oscar time Both are magnificent in their respectful performances portraying two men of opposite personalities but similar goals However David Fincher must be given most of the credit for the sheer intensity and brilliance of the overall structure and experience of this film In the end it doesn t matter what actually happened or what is accurate Being a fictionalized interpretation of the facts Fincher creates with his slick editing low lit scenery and smooth camera work an intelligent and marvelously well sculpted piece of filmmaking that will be remembered for a very long time The final issue that must be addressed is the portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg the founder of Facebook and the youngest billionaire in the world Some including Mark think it s a bit harsh on him seeing him as a totalitarian and ruthless businessman with no heart or sentiment I would argue that it actually is very sympathetic to the Zuckerberg character and the real villain of this story is Sean Parker who lured Zuckerberg away from his friends and supporters with the sensational dreams of changing the world He s already done that and there s no telling what Facebook will turn into next Of course we ll all know about it Just check your Facebook,10
1 November 2010,Fascinating story of the other side of Facebook,It s a rare thing that I ve walked into a cinema screening a new release that s been open for 4 days on a Sunday afternoon and struggled to find a decent seat That was what I found though when I went to see The Social Network it would appear that like the founding of the website it features the film is becoming a social phenomenon I also found it interesting to see that perhaps of the audience were of a certain more elderly age You may not be on Facebook but you d be hard pressed be among the few that haven t at least heard of it It is perhaps not important though because as a film The Social Network manages to convey a fascinating story regardless of your user ship of the involved site David Fincher is an awesome talent and despite my reservations of this project when it first surfaced it is a very accomplished piece of work Direction here is extremely tight the story is straight forward and unfolds easily interspersed with moments from the legal proceedings The way that the story unfolds is quite astonishing and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg comes across as a very clever man brilliant with computers but also a general grasp of everything which makes him almost a little cold and calculated Casting is great Jesse Eisenberg is great as Zuckerberg with his quick fire dialogue but elsewhere there is talent although I must say I struggled with Justin Timberlake in this Dialogue and the script shine throughout and that s important as the film really is a dialogue based one but it never falters throughout The fascination also remains through out the escalation of the site s popularity and therefore the financial side of events are incredible and this behind the scenes format gives you a different understanding of Facebook itself The contrast of friends mucking around with the internet and the onset of million dollar lawsuits which in turn destroys friendships is shocking The scenes that portray the legal proceedings where friends have become enemies and Zuckerberg almost outsmarts everyone are brilliant and for me are the real highlights of the film yet as a whole it s difficult not to be at least a little fascinated What is also remarkable is how Fincher has managed to make this story interesting a quick look at this doesn t really provide a very thrilling story but once you start watching you can loathe Facebook or anything it stands for but still have a excellent film experience the final outcomes and payouts are worth the journey alone the outcome left me gob smacked There is nothing like a good story and Facebook provides it More of my reviews at iheartfilms weebly com,8
24 July 2020,Great movie,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,8
24 February 2021,Overhyped movie,I don t see how people rate this movie so high its long and boring Maybe u have to be into documentary type movies to like this but to me the 2 hours feels much longer I only give this a 2 instead of 1 for the small parts that were of some interest,2
17 February 2011,An interesting look on the creator of Facebook,Facebook is one of the greatest website s ever made You can chat with your friends or tag your friends But David Fincher decided to direct a movie about the creator of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg All I have to say is this This is one of the greatest movie s I ve seen Everything in this film was incredible Even the cast was great Jesse Eisenberg does an excellent job as the smart and mean Mark Zuckerberg Andrew Garfield does a great job as Mark s friend Eduardo Justing Timberlake does a nice job as Sean Parker There s not much else I can say about this movie It s great it s magnificent and it s excellent If you re looking for a good movie to watch The Social Network is worth watching,10
18 December 2010,"Very Good Performance, Boring Movie",I was bored out of my head trying to watch The Social Network it was just a boring and pointless movie The lead actor playing Mark Zuckerberg or Zuckerburg whatever the spelling of that crazy name he did a great job playing the part and I bet he will be nominated for an Oscar for best actor and I can t argue with that but the movie over all was just boring and a waste of time I can t believe it has a rating of 8 out of 10 here on IMDb The other actors were mostly okay but Justin Timberlake was not good or believable at all in his role even though he lost that weight to look younger he doesn t look younger I thought the whole movie was just boring and pointless we already know that this Zuckerberg guy is a total a hole so why do we need a movie about it,
1 August 2012,The Most Overrated Film of Our Generation,The star of the film is a scrawny bland zombie of a person who is only capable of playing one role in every movie he makes At first the plot draws you in but that lasts for about ten minutes and then you realize what a truly horrible movie you are watching If you are obsessed with Facebook you might find some kind of enjoyable aspect but even then this movie has nothing to do with FaceBook in reality Props to whoever thought of making a movie about the most popular website in the world It s a great idea in theory but in practice the concept didn t work for this particular movie AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS,4
5 August 2023,Script works wonders with Fincher's awesome direction.,David Fincher has yet to direct a bad film as none of them had ever been badly directed The Social Network is never boring in many ways with an amazing script from Aaron Sorkin an alluring soundtrack score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross a convincing story with great depth outstanding performances from Andrew Garfield and Jesse Eisenberg everything is paced out well that makes every scene interesting Even when a scene is supposed to be serious there are lines of dialogue that gives way for humor that makes the film stick out until the very end The cuts are perfect that just works great and won t leave its audience bored Perhaps it s one of the biopic films ever made that I can re watch all over again,9
7 October 2010,"My friends, this is the best movie of 2010!",Please do not ignore my following movie review of the grand masterpiece The Social Network Yes I will confirm that there will be plenty of corny puns like in my other movie reviews but you don t get to 500 million puns without making a few enemies The Social Network is Director David Fincher s captivating tale of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg s creation of the infamous social network and it has my affirmation as the best movie of the year Fincher s precise direction first connects with Zuckerberg as a Harvard University student in 2003 when he develops Facemash the who is the hotter Harvard gal from the two site that dismayed many of the Harvard fems but was a major hit with so many hits on campus Zuckerberg got facemashed out of angst of being dumped by his girlfriend one Fall evening in 2003 Facemash also proved that Zuckerberg had no problems hacking away in the Harvard network Facemash was the genesis of what turned out to be the social networking book of all Facebook Zuckerberg partnered with his only friend on campus economics major Eduardo Saverin to develop Facebook a social network website where you know what it is Hello The rest of The Social Network logs on to the rise of Facebook and the legal depositions that sucked in Zuckerberg by those who claimed that the Facebook idea was theirs including the Harvard rowers Winklevoss twins and their diva pal Divya Narendra and even Saverin himself takes a swing at Zuckerberg in this Boston Sue Party The opportunistic Napster founder Sean Parker also gets in the picture not as an angry plaintiff towards Zuckerberg but as one that makes his mark on Mark by seizing opportunities to put Facebook on the profit map If you are still reading this and are not a napster falling asleep on me Facebook me God Bless you for putting up with the puns Speaking of which I am running out of puns so its time to hit the Punbook OK I am back on The Social Network serious sort of speak review state Aaron Sorkin s screenplay of the movie is an ingenious film libretto that delivers in not only characterization but also in authenticity of today s social taxonomy in and out of the net Moreover Sorkin s script highlights the thin line between friendship and ownership Sorkin is in for a Best Screenplay Oscar nom Director David Fincher takes Sorkin s words into the vision of the narrative that makes it a tour de force triumph that will also place Oscar nomination status for King David The thespian network of The Social Network were not lagging on to mediocrity they were exemplary Andrew Garfield was terrific as the gullible Saverin Armie Hammer Josh Pence sure hammered it down in playing both Winklevoss twins in two parts head and body Rooney Mara was all marvel bright as Mark s ex girlfriend Erica Albright Justin Timberlake was bringing his fine acting back by delightfully loading down another commendable performance in portraying Sean Parker and Rashida Jones s work as legal assistant Marilyn Delpy was all legally not wrong in my book But it was Jesse s world Jesse Eisenberg s starring performance as Mark Zuckerberg is by far one that should be posted by the Academy as the one to beat in the Best Actor Oscar race Eisenberg portrayed Zuckerberg with such an authentic multilayered mode that its thespian algorithms formulated Jesse in the elite club of today s best young actors There is a lot more to like of The Social Network that could be depicted in my review But it seems that I have received a request to end my review which I will do The Social Network is a cinematic magnum opus that will connect to many members of the movie going industry and many members of the movie award industry It is the movie event of the year that should be attended by all Excellent,10
22 November 2011,"Dark, haunting, with more than a grain of truth.",These days it seems harder and harder to go to the cinema and see a movie that isn t frankly rubbish The Social Network is the best movie I ve seen since the last century It portrays the beginnings of Facebook probably the most famous and popular website ever creating the youngest billionaire in history Mark Zuckerberg Zuckerberg is played by Jesse Eisenberg who gives an incredible performance of a young man with vastly superior intelligence desperate to make an impression and become somebody By pure chance he is asked to design a website for the college which he agrees to only at some point he decides that the site he s working on should belong to him not them It s well known that a lot of this movie is fictitious but I believe the core emotions and events are very true to what actually happened Zuckerberg fed off the thrill of playing people like pawns gradually shedding his nerdy teenage persona and turning into a ruthless businessman The movie tells the story with atmosphere using dark brooding menacing music it just all comes together and exudes some intangible quality that makes it seem hard to believe that this just happened a few years ago you feel the gradualism of the build up as Facebook gets bigger and bigger and how people quickly get left behind and how Zukerberg and Parker became perfect business partners to create something the world has never seen before It s very brave to make a movie about a true story so soon after it happened If this movie was made 30 years after Facebook was invented it would have been very different The residual emotion that was floating around after these events would have long since evaporated David Fincher did something bold and brave by making this movie The fact that it upset Zuckerberg himself is an achievement in itself He s been portrayed with more accuracy than he s willing to admit,10
1 October 2010,Not everything is private,In The Social Network we follow Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg a sophomore at Harvard University who is looking for a way to make his mark on campus but more importantly to get himself into one of the elite Final Clubs at the prestigious institution but that is easier said than done After creating a website that allows users to rate how hot a female is compared to another he turns the heads of some of the club members Two in particular approach him in regards to an idea they had about social networking for Harvard Mark agrees to help but along the way realizes that this idea is much bigger than they all realize Thus Facebook is conceived Mark s aim is to put the social experience of college online With the help of his good friend Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield and his computer programming friends they make a model for what will eventually be the most popular site this side of Google As the project gets bigger and bigger the network needs to evolve in order to stay alive Enter Sean Parker Justin Timberlake the man who created Napster Sean shows Mark the possibilities of his website while Eduardo is looking to make money instantly Mark who clearly doesn t see eye to eye with Eduardo decides to move on without him creating a divide between the two that would never be repaired The film is cut up between the story and development of Facebook and the lawsuits that Mark found himself in following his massive success one suit coming from the Harvard club members who claim Mark stole their idea and the other from Eduardo who accuses Mark of cutting him out of Facebook unfairly The movie revolves around the character and motives of Mark Jesse Eisenberg gives a career defining performance really embracing the role and giving it everything he has His dialogue is so snappy making him sound so smart clear and ready for anything The writing by Sorkin is outstanding He doesn t wander about the story He gets right to the point highlighting the major incidents that occurred during the early days of this Internet phenomenon The supporting cast around Eisenberg couldn t have been better Garfield as Mark s friend has great presence on screen much like Timberlake who surprised me with his somewhat straightforwardness about Parker It was clear that he was trying to play the character not like his over the top performances from SNL He is doesn t steal the show and he doesn t have to What I like so much about the casting is how nobody has really proved themselves before on the big screen Timberlake is a superstar but hasn t proved until now that he can handle a serious role Eisenberg and Garfield are just starting to get their feet wet and the rest of the cast is for the most part unknown or in the same boat It s because of this that we accept them as the characters they play instead of watching someone like Seth Rogen I was able to watch this movie and just focus on the story not who was up there When I first heard that Eisenberg and Timberlake were slated to star in this film I was a little uneasy When I heard David Fincher was directing I thought it was a joke How could someone like this direct a movie with two actors who primarily do comedy or music videos for JT s sake After watching the trailer I was bought into it This has Fincher written all over it Like his other films Fight Club Se7en The Curious Case of Benjamin Button this has a dark sometimes grimy look to it like a cloudy film was placed over the camera lens creating a dingy often muted look It compliments the old fashioned campus of Harvard perfectly and also creates a much needed dramatic tone If this were shot with bright popping colors it would be a confusing film With the help of Sorkin s script Fincher creates a fast paced drama that really opens our eyes to the world around us What this film does an excellent job of is instead of focusing on college and it s rules and regulations we focus on the impact of this website on all scales from campus to global We see that the power one website can have is astounding but more importantly how rapid an idea can surface be put into production and impact the world For those who aren t familiar with Facebook this is still a movie you can enjoy This isn t a love ballad for the now multi billion dollar company but it s an examination of what happens when friendship meets business when desire becomes creation when innovation turns into a nightmare By the end of the film we don t know what exactly to make of Mark Zuckerberg Granted this film isn t totally accurate but it s clear that this is a man who knows what he wants and understands the risks of acquiring it There are a lot of things to like about this movie and not too many things to hate I would undoubtedly expect great things to come from this film during the award season It rules on all fronts acting directing writing cinematography production design music This one has it all The one thing I hope doesn t come as a result of this movie is The Twit Flick Let s keep it to one social networking film for now,10
11 November 2010,Intelligent and fun,This film is about the founding of the wildly Facebook and the subsequent lawsuits that followed The Social Network has a good script and unconventional story telling The non linear story telling by intersecting scenes reminds me of Memento but in The Social Network it is more accessible The script is full of witty dialogs I really enjoyed all the amazing retorts in the legal meetings The film comes across as a fun intelligent film which young people can easily relate to It s quite amazing that a film about computers can be totally not nerdy at all Facebook is the website at the moment so a film about Facebook will automatically become the film everyone s talking about I thought The Social Network would be over hyped because of this but it turns out that the hype is justified,
13 October 2010,"""The Social Network"" gives Nerds a bad name",I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,9
6 March 2014,Great movie,Great movie on the founding and rise of Facebook and the business machinatians that went on behind the scenes Focuses primarily on Mark Zuckerberg the CEO of Facebook and he doesn t come out looking good Despite the less than flattering portrayal of Zuckerberg and the room for poetic licence the movie comes across as objective and factual and I wouldn t know myself how true it all is Very believable Great direction by David Fincher Pace is intense and never lets up No red herrings or unnecessary detours Camera angles and the like are spot on Good performances all round Jesse Eisenberg is very believable as Zuckerberg Andrew Garfield plays Eduardo Saverin co founder and does a good job Surprise performance is from Justin Timberlake Who knew he could act His music sucks so I always knew he was no musician Although he has been in a few movies previously he has never had a major role and I have always regarded him as appearing in movies to add star appeal rather than for his acting ability He is excellent in this though you feel this is the role he was born to play as the personality and life of Sean Parker seems very much like that of pop star No matter how much truth there is in the story a great movie and definitely worth the watch Only proviso if you re one of the few not on Facebook many of the technical details will go over your head,9
11 December 2022,I think this movie would be a lot funnier if Michael Cera played Mark Zuckerberg,In all seriousness this movie was very good It takes an interesting perspective on what is required of someone to be massively successful I liked Jesse Eisenberg s portrayal of Zuckerberg although I can t see it being completely accurate as I feel they dramatized how mean Zuckerberg was in this movie There wasn t a whole lot of passionate acting from Eisenberg but that was really because his role didn t require it It seems like the director wanted Zuckerberg s character to be almost emotionless and completely driven by success which Eisenberg did quite well Andrew Garfield s acting was kind of weak at the beginning but somewhere in the middle of the movie something flipped and Garfield started to really act I don t know if this was an accident or if it was intentional but it almost seemed like the more Eduardo Saverin was ripped off by Zuckerberg the better Garfield s acting got Justin Timperlake did a great job as the mildly annoying and cocky Sean Parker because Justin Timberlake is mildly annoying and cocky so that worked out perfectly The plot was great although I did wish that it deviated a little from focusing on the lawsuits that were filed against Zuckerberg and pointed more at the effect that Facebook has had on the world and how social interactions have changed because of social media Also I thought it was funny that the movie continued to include the Winklevosses They didn t really have much of an effect on the plot of the movie other than the initial idea of the social network but they did create an interesting side plot I guess Overall I almost feel like this movie gives a message that if you want to be successful you are going to make some enemies Although Zuckerberg did make a lot of people mad with his selfish drive to make the next big thing it was also that drive that made him successful in the first place It s almost depressing how some of the smartest and most successful people on earth are some of the biggest jerks Either way this movie was very interesting and definitely worth watching,8
9 October 2010,Bold Face(book) Type,Like others before me when I initially heard about this project I wondered what could a director as talented as David Fincher see in a Facebook movie I thought this was just a project to keep him busy before his take on The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo What Finch writer Aaron Sorkin saw was an epic tale about human triumph tragedy set in the digital age pretty much encompassed in one man s soul And now we see one of the very best films of the year I rank it along with Se7en The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button as one of Fincher s best films Jesse Eisenberg is spectacular as FB founder Mark Zuckerberg in the most complex performance of the year He is an unsympathetic underdog yet I found myself siding with him He is not an anti hero I often root for anti heroes This guy is something different altogether Know what There is no small amount of Lisbeth Salander in him or his portrayal here But other actors shine here too Andrew Garfield Justin Timberlake yeah that Timberlake hit it out of the park as the burned partner the Svangeli Sorkin s script is a marvel of fast paced dialog is funny as hell I never thought I d be laughing as much as I did here This is by far Fincher s funniest film Jeff Cronenweth s cinematography carries on his father s legacy proudly The score by Trent Reznor co is the most inventive since Hans Zimmer s James Newton Howard s The Dark Knight,10
1 October 2019,The Social Network,Jesse Eisenberg was undoubtedly destined to play Mark Zuckerberg as he brought out the seriousness and the character of young Mark whilst developing one of the world s biggest social networking sites The movie also succeeded in bringing out Jesse to be the best Zuckerberg due to his charisma and seriousness towards his role as well as some striking similarities between him and the character he played through his actions and speech Andrew Garfield s and Justin Timberlake s roles in this movie were not disappointing at all and really helped with the overall aspects of the movie Surely a must watch,9
7 December 2015,Interesting,If I had to sum up The Social Network in just a few words I would probably say It s an interesting movie about an unlikable man At least that s the impression the filmmakers seem to have about Mark Zuckerberg Though to their credit they don t completely portray Zuckerberg as unlikable he is shown to be socially awkward among other things I can personally relate to that trait myself That s one of the many interesting things to be found in this movie Other things include showing how the world of business can be a cutthroat game where friendship and loyalty sometimes don t mean a darn The movie isn t perfect though then again few movies are I would have liked to have been given a little background on Zuckerberg we learn nothing about his past Some of the technical jargon is a little hard to follow if you know little to nothing about computers or Facebook for that matter Also the second half of the movie does have some lengthy portions that run a little slow though they don t get to be downright boring All the same the praise this movie has received is definitely worthy,
1 November 2021,Totally Made Up Story,Recently Mark Zuckerberg CEO of FB has been involved in scandals and the company name has changed to Mata So I concern about FB and I picked this up tonight I was expecting this to be a serious documentary but it wasn t I couldn t enjoy the story and it was the cheapest video making Unfortunately I didn t feel anything of his passion for the IT company And how to describe Harvard students was impolite Anyway this movie got high rated but it wasn t good enough,1
11 January 2011,world's youngest billionaire,David Fincher is a great director with his own trademarks I think the fact that he is the director of the film was the most anticipated thing in the movie for me And I didn t disappoint Fincher again showed a great skill to keep that intension till the end He uses several time differentials which may confuse viewers who are either a little dumb or are not paying their attention However it s not quite clear how can you not focus cause the story is enthralling What I mean is that you who you read this you probably have a facebook account right And I believe you are a bit interested in how a regular 20 year old student with a bright brain managed to create the second most visited website in the world Well you could get you answer in this movie Mark Zuckerberg is the world s youngest billionaire When Bruno Mars sings that he wants to be a billionaire so bad then Mark Zuckerberg actually has proved that even a young man can hit the absolute top All you have to do is to come up with something which basically fascinates the whole world If you visit facebook daily you should see this movie,8
7 October 2010,Pretty good film about the creation of a social and cultural addiction yet it shows it's motives arrived from greed and hormones.,As it s so common today we live in a high tech and fast paced world of technology and social networking and connecting as it s just a part of life despite if you think it s bad or not I for one even though I enjoy the internet and info I m not to big of a fan of social networks like Facebook I say go to a club or read a book Anyhow this film written just perfect by Aaron Sorkin and directed in a long drawn method by the brilliant David Fincher is an interesting and feel good look at how Facebook came about The Social Network starting in 2003 at Harvard you have the brain and nerd geek boy Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg and you guessed it he s lonely and desperate to score with his girl Erica Rooney Mara so instead of giving into the social pressures of clubs and his other peers Mark gives into his anger and starts a fresh new ideal which has Erica to dump him So after returning to his dorm room he starts up a website of fresh faces mostly hot looking chicks that he would like to score with Zuckerberg as he did with his girlfriend Erica starts to type and post nasty items and sexy sayings of which coed he thinks is hotter It s strangely a thing that s a new tech social hit only to university officials Mark himself seems like a new convicted criminal as much of the film is flashback of him being on trial in front of university officials This film mostly serious as it shows an intellect can be interesting and fun it transforms even deeper by showing how Zuckerberg s trip to the Silicon Valley put the final touches on Facebook and his connection with Napster founder Sean Parker good supporting performance from Justin Timberlake spices up and makes this picture sweet sugar as it shows the internet business as dirty which includes cocaine parties with hot young sexy chicks that wear sexy colored bras As it s somewhat of an introduction of a party life for Mark before he becomes a very very rich man Overall The Social Network is a film that captures our times well as it s telling of a cultural and social creation like Facebook was interesting and educational It s made even more watchable with it s intellect intrigue and drama proving that this social creation was motivated by greed and hormone driven lust as this was a way for young men to score and meet hot women Take it for what you want it s an interesting movie that fits our times well of social connection and greed lust driven technology,8
2 October 2010,Easily the best movie I've seen this year,out of You know how each year before the closure of the year there s that one film that s just so highly captivating and involving that you just know it s the movie of the year The Social Network fits that bill completely Out of all seriousness I could not find a single flaw in this film The Social Network is layered with such perfection that trying to find an imperfection in the film is like trying to believe Troll 2 isn t the worst film of all time Words can t describe just the absolute top notch quality of this film David Fincher is not a man behind the camera that just got lucky in the past Potentially excluding Alien 3 every film of Fincher s has been a home run A director can make a fantastic film but hardly does one get away with perfection There has to be at least one plot hole one character that wasn t fully developed or maybe the pacing may be off Nope The Social Network isn t inclusive to any sort of flaw or imperfection Actually typing this review is a mere waste of your time Just pay those ten dollars see the movie then see it again and then see it again The Social Network may be the only film missing on your top five of 2010 list and I sincerely doubt another film will fill in that open slot so I highly suggest you fill in that slot Don t underestimate Fincher s ability or don t second guess the critical acclaim Every great feedback from an individual is simply worth reading because The Social Network is simply a phenomenon It is so perfected that I m willing to say that Fincher is on par with Tarantino Yes I said it The Social Network revolves around Mark Zuckerberg Jessie Eisenberg who recently became the dumpee by ex girlfriend Erica Albright Rooney Mara and frets about being excluded in clubs and decides to join his own Meanwhile Mark meets up with some interested intellectuals who share their ideas about a website Mark is also influenced and inspired by similar chatting websites known as Friendster and Myspace Zuckerberg decides to create a website called Facebook and is exclusive to Harvard students While Zuckerberg is ranking in the cash Eduardo Andrew Garfield is his supporter Sean Parker Justin Timberlake wants to support Zuckerberg s plan so he steps in However Eduardo and Mark s friendship seem to become lose once profit has gotten in their way Eduardo and Mark must suffer the consequences of having a Facebook and even getting sued for supposedly stealing the idea of Facebook First of all the script is so outstanding that I guarantee it will be nominated for an Oscar The one liners are tossed rapidly and certainly witty while steering clear of being pretentious It certainly is a hipster script Furthermore the character development couldn t be stronger There s not one actor or actress who doesn t give it their all Every performance in this film is Oscar potential especially Andrew Garfield Man can that guy act Moreover the pacing is simply perfect The film moves at a slow yet smooth pacing and while there s an abundance of dialog we are so invested with the characters that the conversations are simply indulging To top it off the cinematography is phenomenal You can tell that this is a heavily budgeted film Overall The Social Network doesn t hit the mark it destroys it Everything about this movie is simply phenomenal and flawless Rarely can a film be both but Fincher accomplishes that The performances the script the cinematography the direction the pacing the soundtrack Nothing misses a beat and nothing I tell you nothing can be perfected because it simply is If there s only one movie you see this year make sure it s this one Never have I came out of a theater so proud of spending my hard earned cash So far my favorite films of the year are The Social Network Inception and Toy Story 3 Dear Mr Fincher if film directors could be contenders for God you would certainly be,10
26 December 2010,The Social Network: 9/10,Definitely one of the best films of 2010 and currently is my No 3 of the year slightly behind INCEPTION and THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT but No 1 on my 2010 Top 10 director list David Fincher s last film THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON 2008 is a major disappointment for me though he has remained one of my favorite directors since 1999 s FIGHT CLUB I feel exulted to see he will finally get his overdue Oscar for BEST DIRECTOR next year For me at first I was rather pessimistic towards this project the biographic story of Mark Zuckerberg is surely not Fincher s cup of tea considering SE7VEN FIGHT CLUB and ZODIAC without a dark premise it could turn out to be another case like TCCOBB bland and tasteless Unexpectedly the opening scene between soon to be dumped Mark and his still present girlfriend Erica is mesmerizing and the conversation is sagacious and witty I did watch the scene twice which immediately drew me into a status of devotion especially under of foil of Trent Reznor Nine Inch Nails s arresting music score The acting is outstanding by a rather young cast Jesse interprets a complicated role with his cool headedness and subtlety at the time being he is my No 1 in the leading actor race However Andrew Garfield s performance is much more heartfelt for me as I have seen BOY A I am not surprised to witness how much potential he has under his charming appearance plus he is the new Spider Man I think he could beat Toby Maguire by a mile as far as Oscar speaking The unexpected novae are Rooney Mara and Armie Hammer the former will soon appear in the US version of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO directed by Fincher as well next year as the protagonist she will be rocket boosting like Noomi Rapace this year the latter manifests himself to be a perfect candidate as the new superman Shadowed by the others Justin Timberlake is just okay as least not too annoying and sadly to find out he is aging too Almost everything in the film is flawless the cinematography the editing the tempo the cast I am really appreciated this film to create a meaningful bitter taste of becoming rich and famous at a young age its practical significance could benefit many audience Anyway I feel placid to see this film sweep in the coming Oscar bravo Fincher,9
1 April 2011,"Sharp and refreshing, 'The Social Network' has much to Like.",Directed by David Fincher The Curious Case of Benjamin Button with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin A Few Good Men based on a book by Ben Mezrick called Accidental Billionaires The Social Network is the story of Harvard undergraduate and computer programmer Mark Zuckerberg Jason Eisenberg who works on a new idea for a social website with his friend straight out of his dorm room Called Facebook it becomes a global social network garnering 500 million users and making Mark the youngest billionaire in history while also creating some enemies and legal complications Right off the bat let me first say that The Social Network is a well made film Director David Fincher s stylistically visual direction Aaron Sorkin s acerbic dialogue and Jason Eisenberg s near effortless seeming performance are what make this film beyond the usual biographical businessman and his dream Hollywood tale What s unusual about this film s subject is that the main character of this film is to this day quite young which also means the story doesn t span a very long period of time So a good majority of the film focuses on the details dialogues interpersonal relationships and brain storming sessions I take it the main reason for even making a film about this is the fact that Mark Zuckerberg holds the title of being the youngest billionaire The majority of the film takes place in Harvard where we see Mark his calculated personality his interactions with his friends and nurturing of his ideas Jason Eisenberg is able to bring out the nerdy genius of Mark Zuckerberg with spit fire delivery helped by witty acerbic dialogue and geek speak His performance is convincing and makes it seem like Eisenberg is just playing himself and that he is the genius Also good is his business minded best friend Eduardo Saverin played sympathetically by Andrew Garfield reportedly the next Peter Parker in the Spider Man reboot the more level headed of the two owners of Facebook portraying both the uneasiness and insecurity of being out of the loop when Sean Parker played smart and confidently by Justin Timberlake founder of Napster comes into the picture wanting to take Facebook to another direction Advertisement On the whole the story is about how Facebook came to be and the people who created it and people who fought against it There are some familiar conventionalities in this film like many biographies of this kind along with greed sex drugs and rock and roll Structurally it s nothing new The story is framed within a meeting between Mark and the people and their lawyers who want to sue him for breach of contract or intellectual theft We go back and forth between this current event and the past events in Harvard that helped create this popular network Not unlike Fight Club David Fincher has a way of making any scene visually interesting With camera blurs for depth of field along with his sense of composition and color schemes he makes scenes feel both surreal and personal Even the beginning wide shot credit sequence of Mark walking through the Harvard campus amongst groups of people he doesn t know is interesting in how it visually portrays the whole social network idea While Zuckerberg is portrayed sympathetically in this film he isn t particularly seen here as a good guy either thus the enemies I suppose the irony of the film is how a site that is meant to create friends also created enemies for Mark I enjoyed the quick witted dialogue that came out of Mark s mouth They don t try to dumb down the character for the audience which is refreshing To appreciate this film it probably helps to know how Facebook looks like and how it works For those who have used it they know Facebook itself isn t really that complex or new it s a site that is incorporated in such a way that it s easy loads quickly is somewhat safe and works great with plugins And it is of course quite popular There s little doubt there will be some who will be confused by the computer jargon in this film but they need not worry as it doesn t contribute much to the plot yet still cool to hear anyway I wouldn t go far as to say this film defines the modern generation like some have which I found to be a strange statement It is however a sharp nicely made film and more refreshing than usual I m sure many users will have little problems putting this film on their Facebook s Like list You can also follow my movie review updates on http twitter com d art,8
31 October 2010,"This intelligent and wonderful carousel of fights and agreements filled with lawyers and deceptions is the perfect way to sum the current society, virtual or not.",When I first heard about this project I was pessimistic since I refused to believe in a story about some website where people interact with each other Then David Fincher was announced to direct the movie and that news dazzled me because Fincher is known for his compact complex storytelling so I was kind of biased on this project and still didn t cared about it that much But then months after that the movie came out and an avalanche of positive reviews started Right then I said I need to see this movie what the hell was I thinking It s Fincher for god sake So I grabbed a ticket and I went to see it I must say I was completely satisfied with the movie not only satisfied but impressed and in a way it touched me but I find it a little bit overrated Aaron Sorkin deserves a nomination for best Screenplay since the narrative story and dialogue was perfect No mistake and no cheesy lines just smart content Fincher s excellent directing and storytelling is the ultimate weapon of audience attraction a Facebook movie could have had Each shot followed by next one shows a logical smart and innovative progress through the Facebook creation Not only that but he succeeded to let the viewer acknowledge that s he s not watching just a Facebook movie but more a movie about society s goods and bads Of course the story is based on Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg the young Harvard student who by inspiration and chance became the youngest billionaire in the world Through his moments of brightness he had an accomplice in Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield in creating the main social connector in the world Many said this movie is not based on the real deal behind the creators of Facebook one of them being the Mark Zuckerberg but Fincher never suggested that this movie is about that but more about the social structure of today s world no matter if the society created it s virtual or not Fincher analyzes all the possibilities gives the best interpretation and shows us the naked truth behind the main goals of an adolescent Mark Zuckerberg is the perfect example of that adolescent who can t integrate himself into a society because he doesn t have the required skills to make it there to survive and because of his personal frustrations he succeeds to create the one thing he couldn t be a part of a society Being a virtual society it doesn t really matter in these days when the differences between it and the real one or the one that finds herself in reality are close to none But may I ask which in fact is the real one There s the point of this movie And this intelligent and wonderful carousel of fights and agreements filled with lawyers and deceptions is the perfect way to sum that The cast of Jesse Eisenberg is not only because of the physical but also because of this guy s talent to portray such a simple but in fact deep character But Jesse ain t the top notch as far as acting because the secondary roles held by Justin Timberlake who plays the founder creator of Napster Sean Parker and Andrew Garfield who plays Zuckerberg s partner Eduardo Saverin simply takeover the show I honestly would like to see Andrew Garfield to be nominated in the Best Actor in a Supporting Role at the Academy since he managed to deliver such a great and powerful performance Another place where Fincher always succeeds is the cinematography and editing This film was beautifully shot every take has a meaning and no scene alone was boring or dragged too much The music was also a big contributor to the atmosphere of the movie it s not something the Academy would look after but it definitely delivered With all this the Facebook movie The Social Network is this generation s movie because it reflects our current society and our current beliefs but I also consider it to be a little bit overrated especially considering some critics had the guts to compare this with the Godfather or Citizen Kane I must say this LOUD and clear It ain t nowhere near Citizen Kane or Godfather It s a very very good movie but it doesn t have that strong emotional impact like those movies While I said it impressed me emotionally I am also saying that this doesn t mean it s an powerful emotional movie because it s not It s like a story of a dark twisted fantasy of some poor loser in life which transcends to reality but that s it,9
17 December 2010,Social Disease,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,8

27 June 2023,Favorite biography of all time.,The Social Network As Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg creates the social networking site that would become known as Facebook he is sued by the twins who claimed he stole their idea and by the co founder who was later squeezed out of the business It is about Facebook it is directed by David Fincher and written by Aaron Sorkin instant classic that might be considered as one of the most important films of all time that story is a one to tell they did in the best possible of ways Directing was masterful the frames mostly dark with a yellow theme and it served the movie in many ways Writing was decent Aaron wrote some great dialogs the ones that kept me interested and entertained Technically this movie is a perfect one it was flawless and I can say it s the best biography I ve ever watched Besides it can be very rewatchable Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield carried the film especially Jesse as Mark Zuckerberg zero mistake I still don t know why I haven t seen it till today What was I doing for real Lol,9
29 May 2021,Why such a low rating?,Regarded by many as one of the best films of the last decade and yet it s only rated a 7 7,9
24 April 2011,highly recommended,this movie about the creation of the phenomenon Facebook and the aftermath is one well crafted and compelling movie David Fincher directed it and Aaron Sorkin wrote the screenplay s it s not hard to tell Sorkin had a hand din it the dialogue just pops the acting is superb all around the main characters are well drawn Jesse Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg and it s hard not to feel some degree of empathy for the character though i wouldn t exactly call him sympathetic Andrew Garfield plays Eduardo Saverin a co founder of Facebook but it s Justin Timberlake who i found really impressive as Sean Parker founder of Napster he plays a totally unlikable character and pulls it off perfectly i would highly recommend this film for me The Social Network is an 8 10,8
26 August 2013,From bedroom to boardroom,Steve Jobs didn t invent the graphical user interface But he did produce the first implementation of one in which enough of the details were right for it to be popular And Bill Gates who makes a cameo appearance in this film did not necessarily produce the world s best computer operating system But his system became the first standard and the advantages of using a standard system meant that once Microsoft was big it was destined to become huge Both of these factors technical refinement and network effects help explain the story of Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook And while it s interesting to observe the fine lines that makes one person a billionaire whereas another goes bankrupt it also perhaps tells us that the detailed biographies of those who happen to end up on top are maybe not that interesting or important One might make an exception for Jobs who showed an uncanny knack throughout his career for shaping sector defining products But is Zuckerberg whose social networking software happened to win out over the competition really worth the attention This movie describing the story of Facebook s foundation is perhaps most interesting because its participants most of whom are presented badly here are still alive and indeed young I don t quite know how the script was steered around the lawyers or how true it is It s certainly quite fun to watch a tale of almost schoolboy capitalists hopelessly out of their depth when their business venture turns out to be worth billions although this part of the story would probably work as well without the crazy numbers and when the concept is so nebulous the business so fluid it s easy to understand the lawsuits which led to many people claiming that they really owned the company in some senses the business made itself What does grate is the sense of self assurance and self entitlement shown by the class of Harvard all of whom are depicted as both arrogant and brilliant when their most obvious merits are merely their own well connectedness Again this may be true to life but you won t find any socialistic moralising here Instead there s a snappy though glib script and a surprisingly breathless journey from the bedroom to the boardroom It s a fun film if you like this sort of thing but less insightful than it thinks,7
17 February 2011,"Good movie, just overpraised",When I first saw the trailer to this in theater I thought it was ridiculous and stupid Like they are really running out of ideas but to some degree it beat my expectation I personally didn t think it was a masterpiece like some critics claim but David Fincher did a very good job with what he had The plot is basically about college students at each others throat for a idea a site that is worth billions Now Jesse Eisenberg has been getting a lot of credit for his portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg and for the most part he did a pretty good job but I didn t find it outstanding or anything like that I mean he played his role very well but didn t think it was anything special or anything like that his character just had one note But besides that he did nail the character very well Andrew Garfield did a really good job as well with his character and showed a lot of emotional depth In fact the acting and dialogue of this movie is almost flawless Now there maybe many viewers that may not enjoy this movie as much I personally thought it was pretty good though with the bickering backstabbing betrayal and greed that lead to making facebook And shockingly Justin Timberlake put on a great performance Who knew that guy could actually act But he was probably just playing himself Just not a amazing awesome movie that some critics claim it to be I mostly liked the visual style of it all Again the best part about this movie is the performance and the sharp dialogue And I know this movie is about how facebook came about but it wouldn t have hurt to dove into the mind of Zuckerberg more and more development The film just didn t grab my interest it didn t really have a good start but got my attention a bit during the middle and started to lose it when it got near the end This really isn t a bad film it has good camera techniques to go with some of the positive aspect of the film I named But the topic at hand just isn t interesting and didn t feel all that compelling 7 4 10,7

24 September 2010,Superb Acting!,I just saw this movie at a screening in Chicago IL and was so drawn into the story Jesse Eisenburg Andrew Garfield and even Justin Timberlake gave superb performances I was pleasantly surprised with the storytelling itself Despite many critics saying Zuckerberg is portrayed in a negative light throughout the movie I found myself pulling for him caring for the character and even feeling badly for him at times Which is just silly when facebook is worth at least 25billion I believe it was Eisenberg who gave such a great performance who make me like Zuckerberg so much Bravo to everyone involved,9
18 August 2021,"I still haven't deleted my ""Facebook"" profile",I don t know that what happened is as true as it is I have never researched it Facebook is not as famous as it used to be and most people have closed their profiles But as a movie it was interesting,7

27 December 2010,As clean as they come,One of the finest of its kind movie for this year no doubt Fantastic cast and performances all around You don t get a good movie just because you have few talented actors in it The director is the one who can use it effectively to bring out a great movie Flincher has done just that in this movie Not one instance I felt the movie was boring or has some unnecessary scene It has an amazing touch of class from start to end Very few true stories are converted to good movies which are as effective as the story itself Usually these types can get monotonous at some point in the movie but not this one I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who has a good taste for movies and also for the ones who are submerged into facebook everyday,9

1 September 2014,A film for my generation?,Looking through the reviews on this site it s hard to really add anything new about The Social Network It s brilliant I can hardly fault it However I am a serious Facebook addict currently undergoing electric shock treatment to help myself cut down so it fascinated me to hear about the back story as to how it was created who owned it and who nearly owned it I would rate this 9 10 great performances great direction David Fincher I now officially forgive you for your part in Alien 3 and great pace So as an experiment and in keeping with my 9 10 rating I invited my Mum and Dad round to watch it The second time around I enjoyed it as much as the first In short when I asked my parents to rate it out of 10 they gave it a 5 and a 6 They didn t get it They didn t understand Facebook or the fuss about it They didn t understand anything more technical than the term the web and they found all the characters unlikeable and annoying Only a few hours after the credits rolled and my Mum was having difficulty remembering anything other than people were generally moaning at each other over something that involved money I guess if you re one of the stereotypical Facebook generation you may love this If not stick with your knitting and no my Mum will never read this I m now off to cut and paste this whole review to my status please feel free to comment oD http thewrongtreemoviereviews blogspot co uk,9
19 November 2019,Possibly my favourite film of all time.,To me this film is perfection everything from the cinematography to the story is astounding I don t think there is anything you could do to improve it And as much as I adore The Kings Speech this should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture As a huge David Fincher and Jeff Cronenweth fan I will and have watched anything they do together with everything that they have worked on together being at least an 8 10 but I cannot speak for anybody else With a Sorkin script and stunning visuals as well as direction this film is more indulgent than anything that I watched from the 2010s and would go as far as to say this is in my top 3 favourite films of all time As far as it goes for the soundtrack all I can say is that it is phenomenal Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross bring everything together with In Motion being my favourite from the collection Having watched this many times before and with my favourite scene since the beginning is the original hacking scene where they are creating Face Smash being possibly the best in the entire film It also the perfect amount of comedy and seriousness that has somehow bonded together extremely well I can easily watch this film on repeat and no matter how many times I have seen it I will be able to watch it again For me this is absolutely a 10 10 and I would go as far as to call it a masterpiece With Gone Girl being a very close second in terms of pacing and cinematography And for it being a 9 year old film it definitely holds up to any standards that there are today 10 10,10

30 January 2011,Sorkin and Fincher Create Wonder,Anything written by Aaron Sorkin is worth seeing To say the least his work is sharp witty clever and funny I doubt I would have been as eager to see The Social Network if it was written by someone else It only adds to the excitement that David Fincher is directing the film He s more of a visual director whose films have a dark claustrophobic feel Now I was very curious about what a Sorkin Fincher collaboration would yield Even though I pretty much knew I was going to like it the outcome still surprised me especially how Sorkin s lines and Fincher s direction came together Needless to say the execution is first rate Fincher maintains his trademark dim lighting and spacious in motion cinematography The editing is equally meticulous Given that the concept is about Facebook one would expect pretty much an almost rags to riches story and if I hadn t known of Sorkin and Fincher I would have expected the same but this is far from the clich d underdog becomes billionaire story The themes presented are quite dark and The Social Network is a character driven film The majority of the cast is very good Jesse Eisenberg is excellent as the awkward and intelligent loner who s making millions all of a sudden Andrew Garfield is competent as Mark s only friend who stands by him Rashida Jones stands out in a brief role The only weak link is Justin Timberlake who cannot seem to act even under the direction of someone like Fincher To those of you who think The Social Network is just some ditzy movie about Facebook or is all hype and low on substance you ll be surprised I doubt one can go wrong with Sorkin and the addition of Fincher only makes this a must see,
3 March 2014,Mark Zuckerberg and the story of Facebook...,The Social Network is a movie which shows us the true story of Mark Zuckerberg who is now a well known person because of his creation the Facebook It shows us also all the story between him and two brothers who sued him because they claimed that he stole their idea Another thing that this movie shows us is that Mark Zuckerberg squeezed out of the business his best friend and co founder of Facebook I liked this movie because is based on a true story facts and because of the direction of David Fincher which I think that it was just magnificent I also liked the interpretations of Jesse Eisenberg s who plays as Mark Zuckerberg Andrew Garfield s who plays as Eduardo Saverin the co founder of Mark Zuckerberg and Rooney Mara s who plays as Erica Albright and is simply beautiful Finally I have to say that The Social Network is a really nice movie which I believe that everyone have to watch it because it shows us many things that all of us must watch and think about them,7
20 July 2019,Taught me a lot of things,I loved this movie Not only did it provide a great storyline it also provided equal insight into both sides of the legal battles between the Winklevoss Twins and Mark Zuckerberg I also learned a lot from the film about Facebook and it s origins would highly recommend if oh want to be entertained and learn at the same time,10

13 October 2010,Computer guys the new Rock Stars,There will probably be a surge in computer science majors as we witness youthful tech savvy nerdy types emerge as the new rock stars of the 21st century Their computer ingenuity and creativity lead them to fame fortune and even groupies A character study about someone who becomes a billionaire in his twenties is expertly blended with subject matter that is so relevant to our times results in one of the greatest movies of the past decade The filmmakers and actors created such a believable Zuckerberg with such human emotions and motivations that we totally connect to this all too familiar idiosyncratic smuggy nerd who fascinatingly becomes one of the billionaire rock stars of the information age He is mentored by fellow internet rock star Napster founder played by Timberlake The subject matter of the business and legal ramifications of conjuring an online site raises interesting philosophical questions Questions such as who is really deserving someone that comes up with the idea or the creator themselves and how deserving is a confounder who plays a small financial role at the onset but who was nothing to do with the creative drive These are some of the questions that will make the audience think about these contemporary issues The dialogue written in a way where characters go tit for tat at unnaturally supersonic speeds was a throwback to Carey Grant classics however the modern edge and relevancy makes it engrossing and ears will be fully opened to the intense verbiage Amusingly tells the story of facebook founder s development and initial success with the site Much of what he did in the initial founding years created controversy amongst those somewhat connected to the site and those wanting a piece of the pie Two major legal disputes ensue and the film is structured through depositions dealing with these disputers The haughty and annoyed Zuckerberg is visibly put off by these minor encumbrances and is seething to get back to his passion and baby facebook We hear of new controversies during the depositions and we see the flashbacks to the college years where these controversies got started which is a major part of the saga of the spawning and growth of facebook The tad Gothic and moody atmosphere with the highly sensationalized decadence gives an entertaining if a little over the top feel to the collegiate setting The movie opens and wraps up perfectly with a speculative witty theme of the human component that creates the drive and motivation for these youthful internet entrepreneurs,10
17 January 2011,Another movie favoured by everyone...except me!,Sadly enough yet another movie that everyone is going to love and i will be when asked if i saw the face book movie question going meh it was alright So many movies that people rave and rave about that i have seen myself it actually makes me wonder sometimes if its just me or does anyone know what a good movie actually is Sure i m a Facebook fan and have a profile in fact that s how i type out all these reviews i do for flixster The story itself is a remarkable one about one man s luck and the battle for corporate greed that ensues A solid cast i m getting more impressed with Justin Timberlake the more i see him as he seems to be upping his game as well as Jessie Eisenberg who portrays Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in this film It pretty much swept last night s golden globes and from what i hear they are a prelude of whats to come for the big night at the Oscars I personally am rooting for The Fighter myself as i enjoyed it way more than this Maybe im too old fashioned who knows,4

16 January 2019,Insightfully Meaningful,1 March 2014 After three years of avoiding watching this film because I knew I wouldn t like it especially the title character perhaps I had been channeling Steve Jobs or something but now that the deed is done I must admit I was wrong There is subtle elegance in how all the characters came across What makes this movie so meaningful and powerful is its deliver of non stereotypical flat overly dramatic characters and instead the audience is offered up a more complex and deliciously appealing set of characters that seem real and sympathetic in almost every person presented I enjoyed how the movie ended and how each character seemed to be a victim of the system of economics of business development each with their own honorable take on how it should be This movie isn t so much about right and wrong but how one s own personal identity interacts with the innate conflicts and tensions of anything new There is both sufficient anger and sympathy to go all around While I didn t like the constant flashback technique used in this movie as the background method of presenting the main story I can t really come up of another way it could have been done which says a lot in itself,9

1 June 2020,Compelling story and acting,It s not a very glamorous story but David Fincher does a good job of adapting it to the big screen The best part was the acting Although this shows the founding of a modern company it does not seem like it imposes a stance on the company and it works as a compelling story in its own right,7
28 September 2019,Clever,Overall this was an entertaining and well made film The narrative structure keeps you engaged There is a lot of detail about the creators of Facebook and it s fascinating The actors do a great job for the most part Andrew Garfield s Performance is inconsistent at times but he nails the emotional scenes Eisenberg creates a very interesting character Timberlake does a good job in his supporting role but the character is quite generic The film at times became boring especially in the second half where too much time was given to the other part of the story about Harvard connect Solid film overall,8
27 May 2020,Good but not great,It s a good movie well played but not so well documented,7
4 March 2011,Monomania not social skills,Here is a film that is impossible for me to review without interjecting my own experience as a software engineer Most of what is shown in the film I have experienced in microcosm everything from a lawsuit intellectual theft the CS courses spending countless hours writing source code dealing with some of the most emotionally inept humans on the planet and some of the most brilliant being part of a start up during the dot com era having a company grow exponentially that company fell faster than Icarus but that has not happened to Facebook yet money freely flowing and being betrayed There are not many industries that are as paranoid as the software industry The amount of non disclosure agreements paranoia and intellectual theft make the industry feel more like cloak and dagger than what an outsider to the industry might just think as a playground for nerds and geeks Mark Zuckerberg has an idea Well technically the best kind of correct two twin rowers the Winklevoss s have an idea both played by Armie Hammer To improve a social network specific to Harvard They recruit Zuckerberg after he performs a hack that brings down the school network with a program that allows users to compare the looks of randomly chosen females downloaded from several sites But Mark avoids the two and with a business partner and best friend Eduardo Saverin and one additional programmer set out to create their own version of a social network for the school Ideas are constantly stolen and you expect that they will be stolen So it is a bit harder for me to feel for the Winklevoss s on this issue Their naivety seems a bit much for Harvard but it does happen Its exponential popularity helps excite the interest of nerd badboy played well by Justin Timberlake Sean Parker whose narcissistic behavior is legendary and only upstaged by a company he helped create in Napster With this unholy union the company expands even more But at what cost and will it survive the enemies that have been created not only by the success but by the enemies created from within the company Jesse Eisenberg s portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg is sublime and spot on It does not help if you have been around many variants of this personality and their borderline or full Asperger s Syndrome They are certainly easier to take in a two hour movie but not as fun when you work with them and every single perceived fault is ripe for an acerbic comment But the monomania that is displayed akin to The Nutty Professor while stereotypical is quite true When you are working on a problem or a perceived solution it can dominate you and make you oblivious to anything else His surly and sarcastic conduct no matter what the setting certainly defies social normalcy especially in the trials but that is also quite true of this creature While I do feel the film has been overrated and I am somewhat glad it did not win the Oscar I do feel it is a good film and I enjoyed watching it There is some sloppiness to it though In a particular scene to show Mark Zuckerberg s intellectual prowess as he leaves in the middle of a problem in a CS course leaving for a personal issue the professor calls him out and states that not everyone will be successful in response he of course answers the question to the bewilderment of the professor This is analogous to the Jeopardy scenes in films where answering is to show your mental acuity Another scene was the Eureka scene where an individual comes to him and discusses an idea which facilitates hey The Facebook needs a marital status That idea has been used way before The Facebook BBSs for example It also seems weird to me that they eschewed the whole MySpace rivalry I know you have to streamline a story but that was such an important part of so many decisions and attitude that Facebook went through that it seem like a whitewash of history Though I have to admit David Fincher made a difficult subject interesting If you focus too much on software concepts you will have a film full of jargon that is indecipherable to but a few He kept this at a minimum with a few references here and there with I think only one mention of Perl and a few mentions of PHP This is wrong in the portrayal because these individuals nomenclature would be esoteric though still quite sarcastic the amount of jokes I have heard on design patterns like a Singleton or basic concepts like hash maps could drive a person crazy but I certainly would not dock the film for taking the high road In fact because of this I really enjoyed the sardonic dialog Also the score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross which would win an Oscar is outstanding Though anytime I hear Edvard Grieg s Hall of the Mountain King I always think of Fritz Lang s M I did have a suggestion for a name change drop the The,8

21 July 2021,Beautiful,Beautiful film that tells the story of the founder of Facebook and all the difficulties he had to face and that for the most part he created himself The film never tires in its entire duration managing to keep a high level of interest from the viewer,10
30 October 2010,A great film that leaves you wanting more,When The Social Network was first announced as a film about Facebook I was skeptical about whether the film would be worth seeing or not However once I saw the trailer I could not wait to see the film and I am glad to say that it does not disappoint David Fincher is one of those directors whose style is in everything that he makes and while at first that may not seem appropriate for a film about Harvard students creating a social website it somehow makes the film better Were this in the hands of another director I don t think the film would have been as well received The choice in music camera angles editing lighting and the cast is all brilliant What will immediately hook the audience in is the which which is so sharp and witty From the first five minutes we quickly get to know who Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Isenberg really is and what he is like around other people While at first it may seem strange that someone like him would be best friends around the likable Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield who is caring and forgives Mark for some of his actions their friendship it believable This makes it a shame that we know that their friendship will never last The acting in this film is great and all of the cast fit their roles perfectly Jesse Insenberg is fantastic to watch as is Andrew Garfield who is an actor clearly worth watching Rooney Mara despite a small role is good Armie Hammer who plays both twins is excellent and Justin Timberlake shines in another role as the founder of Napster Despite how engaging the film is I found myself wanting to see more as if the film had been edited down for commercial reasons The film lasts 2 hours and within that running time it tells the story effortlessly thanks to David Fincher s direction but I wish more time was spent on the relationship between Mark and Eduardo as the film is constantly progressing forward The film is well worth watching and I will certainly be interested in watching it again Fincher continues to impress and I look forward to seeing what comes next for him and the actors in this film,9

17 March 2020,Very beautifully scripted and directed,The Social Network is a biographical movie directed by David Fincher and stars Jesse Eisenberg Andrew Garfield Justin Timberlake Armie Hammer and Max Minghella in the leads The best part of the movie is that the movie is very intelligently scripted and directed with a very tight screenplay David Fincher is one of the best director of Hollywood and he displays his forte The characters have also enacted beautifully and does proper justice with their roles The movie is a must watch movie and enjoyable with tight screenplay A must watch,9
29 September 2011,"One-part legal drama and one-part dialogue driven standoff; the film is an elegant picture, depicting some less than elegant people, which makes for engrossing viewing.",Usually when characters have their faces illuminated whilst shot in tight close up from a light source located just below that of their chin it is to bring about a certain ghoulish uncanny border line evil sense to proceedings There is a nightclub set scene in David Fincher s The Social Network in which two male characters dominate the conversational proceedings between themselves in doing so shallow chit chat with their write off girlfriends whom happened to be in the right place at the right time plays out on occasion Their faces filling the frame are periodically lit up by that of several shades of primary colours located beneath the glass of the tables at which they sit the acute angle of their positioning causes great flourishes of light which are shed all over their facial features but done so in a fashion rendering them somewhat frightening The characters are of course shady and approaching despicable even ghoulish people about to make a lot of money off a world of young and vulnerable people living in a day and age in which modernity has gone mad technological advancements are implemented unto us as must have accessories in spite of whether one requires them and folk are exposed to computerised services allowing them to forge online identities which has on occasion led to what people have defined as a sickness Welcome to the film about the person or people whom helped invent this item and their struggle to cash in on the riches that come with it They call it Facebook an online service allowing people to create their own web pages of personal information post recent happenings in life and put up all manner of content complimentary or otherwise that age old idea of young people better off being seen and not heard has long since departed The film is a near perfect telling of a four or so month law suit which reared up over the winter of 2003 and briefly crossed over into 2004 an indelible balancing of several people on two sides of a particular fence in overall reference as to whom began the aforementioned website which took the online world by storm and as to how much in the way of riches either person is entitled to It is remarkably written beautifully played and wondrously directed Fincher chopping back and forth from strand to strand from equilibrium to equilibrium in the manner that tells us it is a director at the top of his game For starters the pleasure one derives from a film such as The Social Network bears little to the items simmering away at the core of it one needs to know of Facebook or indeed possess a Facebook account in about as much a capacity as one needs to know an awful lot about agricultural science in order to enjoy Tony Gilroy s 2007 film Michael Clayton a good thriller is a good thriller regardless of its subject matter Jesse Eisenberg plays American Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg a talkative frizzy haired kid in his early twenties with a room on campus and a tight circle of friends and girlfriends Eisenberg nails the role with a steely glare and an affecting robot like demeanour delivering long passages of cutthroat speech in a cold and precise manner he reminds us of another coldly blank antagonist although only really an antagonist supporting proceedings in a world of ever decaying social strata from Fincher s past work that of Kevin Spacey s John Doe In terms of framework we liken him to Gyllenhaal s character from Fincher s 2007 film Zodiac a lead whom happens upon a coded item proceeds with it and then gets in deeper than he should have done Zuckerberg on account of being too frank and talkative with a girlfriend one night at a university bar breaks up with her and lumbers back to his halls alone on a dreary Autumn evening The glumness of his marital situation is encapsulated in the foreboding music motivating proceedings but brief squirts of pleasant piano keys in amidst it reiterate the germ of a good idea trying to break through out of the scuzzy situation His superiority at least over other students of his age ethnicity and sexuality is enforced when inter cut with his devising of a social networking formulae we observe numerous other students simultaneously drink fool around and stand on coffee tables in their underwear such are the things one gets up to at university Andrew Garfield plays Eduardo Saverin a friend and roommate but a later rival for the claim of the benefit payouts two brothers these fantastic physical specimens whom row and maintain their build like Zuckerberg is able to think along mathematical lines are named Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss although are both played by Armie Hammer in an instance of flawless duel acting on the man s behalf The plot takes care of itself suffice to say the film cuts back and forth to the ongoing battle over what amount should be paid to whom and how they all came to reach this situation The film splices between either strand effortlessly the reality of the fact we are aware of what the situation on the past strand will eventually lead to in no way detrimental to the overall intensity of the drama unfolding overall The film s indelible manoeuvring of these characters around a chess board of sorts as loyalties to one and then the other and differing factions are born out of events what look like betrayals and distrust is the real joy the film a mesmerising drama rocketing Fincher away from the spasmodic pseudo teary The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and back to a recurring forefront of men wading through decrepit sociological surroundings battling with themselves as well as the other men of distorted opposites they appear to have more in common with than would like whom occupy that space with them,8
27 October 2010,Fascinating Topic!,As a person whose had a Facebook for awhile I never thought once to how or when it was made or under what circumstances Who would ve ever thought to make an actual film about the story behind the creators of the popular blog site Facebook and what led them to making it The history behind it is a lot more than I would think And in this box office success it takes us far into the story of how it all started After being dumped by his girlfriend Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenburg along with his skilled computer friends are assigned to create a new blog site by the Winklevoss twins In no time they officially create Facebook But conflicts arise when the twins blame them for stealing their idea As Facebook becomes more and more popular Mark becomes one of the most famous people in the world and to this day is the youngest billionaire in the world One thing I loved right off the back about this film was how intelligent the dialogue was As the beginning progresses Mark starts hacking into the Harvard computer system which is a very entertaining scene He starts typing all his notes and thoughts really fast The editing in this movie killed I expect an Oscar nomination from this film It went by quite smooth One downfall was the main character For one thing he s a real jerk Yet you feel like your suppose to care for him and like him which makes you struggle to decide whether you like him or not I for one liked him despite his rudeness sometimes Although they might have twisted the actual person s attitude the film somehow got away with it The other characters are just okay with Andrew Garfield playing Eduardo Saverin the vice president of Facebook He starts getting angry with Mark for taking most of the credit for creating Facebook leaving him in the dust Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker was also a lame character who takes part in Facebook and turns it upside down For what it is I really liked this film a lot The characters the fast paced editing the idea and just everything else With a few flaws it still turns into a 8 10,10
5 November 2010,Unflattering,Only a few years ago no one had ever heard of Facebook for one reason it didn t exist Today 1 out of every 14 people in the world has a Facebook account For those unaware Facebook is a social networking technology that allows people to share their daily lives including photos and videos to friends all over the world While it has changed the way people communicate with each other in fundamental ways some decry the communication as superficial and issues of privacy have arisen The company led by its founder and CEO 26 year old Mark Zuckerberg however has reached the plateau of having 500 million users a phenomenal achievement in so short a period of time David Fincher s film The Social Network covers the early days of the founding of Facebook when Zuckerberg was a nineteen year old student at Harvard Written by Aaron Sorkin it is an indictment of a young man s obsession with status and greed at the expense of loyalty to friends What is implied by Sorkin who admits that social media holds little fascination for him is that cool sites such as Facebook offer no benefits to mankind The picture presented of Zuckerberg is of a friendless computer geek incapable of having close relationships an angry obnoxious and egotistical young man In reality Zuckerberg comes across as warm articulate and highly sociable a person that really cares about making the world open The film based on the partly made up book Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich is a blend of fact and fiction that has Zuckerberg played by Jesse Eisenberg inventing Facebook as a means of revenge against a girlfriend who rejected him and in order to raise his social status after he was refused entry into an elite all male final club at Harvard In an opening scene that borders on the chaotic with music pounding in the background the camera focuses on Mark and his girlfriend Erica Rooney Mara sitting at a table in a bar bantering at a rat a tat speed about him fearing he will be rejected if he applies for a Harvard final club Mark is trying to win over Erica but is depicted as so socially awkward that the conversation soon boils over into personal attacks and leads her to remark that Dating you is like dating a Stairmaster a line of exercise machines in reality the supposed friendless Mark had a girlfriend in college Priscilla Chan and they are still together today His feelings deeply hurt and seeking revenge for the rejection Mark insensitively concocts a website called Facemash where he hacks into various school sites to obtain and display pictures of various girls on campus asking users to pick the hottest treating all girls as sex objects to be used for his entertainment In a sad commentary on the blatant sexism on the campus Facemash becomes so popular that it crashes the entire Harvard computer system This event leads wealthy members of Harvard s crew team Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss Armie Hammer and their friend Divya Max Minghella to recruit Zuckerberg to help in developing a new website called The Harvard Connection one that will allow students to line up dates and communicate with each other using the campus server While this might have seemed original to the twins in fact a service called Club Nexus began operating at Stanford University two years earlier using that very approach Mark agrees to work with the twins but deliberately misleads them about his intentions sending them e mails about how busy he is apparently to delay their own project which he worried might be potentially competitive At the same time he is working on a new project called The Facebook which he is designing along with his friend Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield one of the films few sympathetic characters Events are shown in flashback as the film zeroes in on later hearings resulting from two depositions one by Eduardo who claims that he was lied to and betrayed by Zuckerberg and the other by the Winklevoss twins who sued Mark for supposedly stealing their idea and their code Launched in February 2004 The Facebook enrolled a ton of Harvard students in the first month of its creation Saverin contributes his own funds to aid in the startup and is made Chief Financial Officer It is then discovered by the co creator of Napster Sean Parker Justin Timberlake an aggressive Web entrepreneur who thinks in terms of expansion not only to other college campuses in the U S but all over the world As it continues to expand the name is changed simply to Facebook Mark drops out of Harvard and moves to Palo Alto California The final scenes show an increasingly lonely individual almost a tragic hero who may have gained the whole world but has lost his own soul The Social Network is an entertaining and extremely well made and beautifully acted film that holds our interest for its full two hour run Unfortunately all the creative geniuses are men while women are shown as little more than empty headed groupies and sex objects eager to serve the boys While much of the film is accurate in terms of the events portrayed and except for the invented put downs of the lawyers the twins and Saverin much of the language is taken verbatim from legal transcripts While Fincher makes some good points about what is really important in life it seems that in order to be dramatic Fincher had to show Zuckerberg in an extremely unflattering manner almost to the point of destroying his character,8
11 October 2010,Excellent story of the origins of FACEBOOK.,Based on a true story although after watching this I m not sure how much of this movie is true or creative license But who cares I consider this movie to be a masterpiece The story about Mark Zucerberg Jesse Eisenberg an undergrad at Harverd in 2003 he collided with friend Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield to create a website called Facebook What starts out as a college thing soon becomes a bigger popular internet thing It s not long before they become billionaires And some scandal moments that will follow David Fincher direction is brilliant since Benjamin Button Jesse Eisenbergs performance is an Oscar gold so was Andrew Garfield The film manages to never to get boring with it s witty dialog Justtin Timberlake is terrific so was Brenda Song who manages to breakaway from Disney Like I said this movie is a masterpiece,10
20 October 2010,A depressing and realistic view of the world we live in.,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,8

23 February 2016,Great acting movie,In some ways I do think this film was made a bit early Facebook isn t that old a phenomenon and thus a movie about its origins seems rushed as I don t think we have enough distance to view it objectively That being said David Fincher has pulled off some miracles here and I think this is about as perfect a movie about Facebook as was possible to be made Some of its events and depictions can be argued with and you can definitely see that sometimes things are stretched in the name of drama but as a story it works really well and will definitely give you some perspective on the web page most of us have come to rely on And at the centre of it all is Mark Zuckerberg played by Jesse Eisenberg in probably his best role performance so far Zuckerberg is a great character From the very first scene where he s talking with his college girlfriend you get this guy He s a genius and in his case it s also a burden a curse He s in a constant state of frustration because to him everyone else seems to be moving in slow motion Everyone is always one or two steps behind and he has to slow done to let them catch up The movie deals with Zuckerberg s days in college while he was getting Facebook off the ground and with the legal battles that he had to go through later because everyone tried to stake their claim on the pot of gold he had founded The movie is good at not taking sides and showing that while Zuckerberg certainly did some slightly questionable things it s not like the other side was completely in the right either All in all The Social Network is worth a watch because it has great actors lead by a great director and the subject matter is something we re all familiar with and know personally Best film of the year Probably not but it s up there,7
14 March 2023,Unbelievable Start-Up World Realism,I loved this movie Jesse Eisenberg is absolutely electrifying as the quirky and strange super geek commander of the meta verse aka Mark Zuckerberg He is absolutely sensational in it and his performance is exactly what carries this movie The script writing is almost perfect apart from a few silly gooths and for show cinema The score is epic Great to hear Gluecifer on the party scene All hail the kings of rock The coding scenes when everyone is rampaging through to get to the 11th hour deadline is staggering It s quite similar to the Spotify movie but it s done much better as it s not got silly make up stuff in it assuming Arsenal would be losing after his failed approach when they re now top and it s alarmingly accurate to how Facebook evolved during this period I was an early user of Facebook Gmail etc The Dorm scenes are just genius How do we get to find out about girls Create a bible of their relationship status Just wow It s so on point it s scary It s like opening a neurotic turned on adolescent mind just discovering his adulthood and using science and technology to effectively pull girls It give you a great insight into the often narcissist tech geniuses lifestyle great article on Forbes on this and their bull in a china shop approach to people It s a great movie for therapists to understand human behaviour and the desire for total control and engagement Facebook is the software which so many of us use and it took a very special mind to create it and this give you that inside information of how that occured It s a great movie A definition of a colloquialism control freak is Zuckerberg It s his way or it s not happening at all It happened and I m in awe of what he achieved and very grateful but I m also glad to not have been part of the process which this movie so realistically tells you,9
22 December 2021,The Social Network,8 10 great writing and terrific performances abound in this star studded look behind the blue curtain of Facebook but it was Andrew Garfield s nuanced acting that really sold this for me,8
26 June 2020,Gabe Review #3,Really incredible performances all around especially Eisenberg and Garfield absolute kill it Not sure it s historically accurate but has a great story Also contains an amazing way of telling the story by flicking between the present and past Definitely worth a watch even if it isn t all true Also I want to punch Sean Parker really really hard in the throat,7
14 March 2012,Rich Dialog and Angular Characters Fuel a Wild Intellectual Expedition,David Fincher s take on the men behind a social networking juggernaut is an ensnaring riff on adolescent genius intellectual property misplaced loyalty and the blurred line between inspiration and plagiarism Jesse Eisenberg is magnetic as the quick lipped scorned socially acidic orchestrator Mark Zuckerberg armed with both a fiery stockade of dialog and a vibrant crew of supporting actors to fire it at he never wants for the right words nor the perfect target for an occasion Eisenberg is especially effective in the dry serious legal hearings he s subjected to throughout the plot where he s most at liberty to cut to the quick with a pointed jape or toy with the formulaic arguments of a prosecutor Sufficiently technical without flooding the plot with IT speak it s as sharp and engaging as Good Will Hunting if not as touchy feely and redeeming When it was all said and done I was left with the same impression of Zuckerberg as I was of Steve Jobs after finishing his biography the guy s a scumbag but he found his sweet spot in this world and made the most of it for both himself and society at large,9
24 April 2011,Sork the Finch of the Eisenzuckerberg.,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,8
13 January 2020,"Smart, Engaging Drama",The Social Network is incredibly intelligent and engaging It has a great cast and a very strong screenplay The movie is about college student Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg who with the help of his best friend Eduardo Saverin Andree Garfield creates the global phenomenon Facebook The story is framed around two lawsuits against Mark one from the Winklevoss twins Arnie Hammer and Eduardo himself Justin Timberlake plays the playboy character of Shaun Parker he does such a good job I really hated him at the end The actors do a great job in this film Jesse Eisenberg delivers his lines with speed and sarcasm which is very entertaining to watch Andrew Garfield is also fantastic he brings a vulnerability to his character and makes the friendship between the two leads believable Arnie Hammer is playing two versions of himself yet each of them feels distinct The music stands out as well It perfectly matches each scene and is tonally accurate The dialogue is written by Aaron Sorkin who is known for his snappy screenplays This film is no exception it really elevates the movie and makes it more exciting The pacing is quick it moves along without feeling rushed or too long The themes of fame and wealth are profound and subtle adding a very important layer to the film Overall this is a fantastic movie It has an excellent cast a great screenplay engaging story good music and a good pace I have no real complaints I loved it,8
29 April 2012,Up to date real life success story,Now you might wonder why yet an other review of this movie Well the more the better as it proves the movie is talked about which means it brings a message like it or not That is what Facebook is as well like it or not But in the end it does not really matter as it has proved to be a success The movie is well played The story well written It s a very believable story I am sure not everything is like depicted in the movie but does that really matter It s a movie not a documentary The characters play very believable personalities I am not a drama watcher really thrillers war movies that is my thing But I really enjoyed this movie Being a relative Facebook fan it s interesting to see how the whole idea evolved into what it now is Watch it sit back and relax let it take you into the world of intelligent people who create a vision It s entertaining too,9
17 October 2010,Genesis not quite Genius,A few minutes into The Social Network we are presented with a fairly staggering piece of irony that stuck with me for the rest of the film and that is that the would be creator of the ultimate social networking tool would himself be a socially inept outcast eager to find acceptance and inclusion within the Harvard University elite So in tracing the genesis of the Facebook The Social Network whilst wrestling with concepts of creation and inspiration finds the idea in it s simplest form early on defining the subject in it s own necessity from the outset Core to the film are relatively routine thematic dynamics such as greed betrayal and of course friendship those who are familiar with Director David Fincher s previous works such as Seven 1995 and Zodiac 2004 will recognise Fincher s look at the inner workings and purpose of his characters relationships as well as the speed in which those relationships come and go in way reminiscent of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button 2008 The Narrative of the film is constructed cleverly through the use of two depositions which effectively provide a running commentary of two stories Both depositions feature our central character Mark Zuckerburg Jesse Eisenberg as he attempts to stave off those claiming credit for the invention that would go on to define him The Facebook The first sees Zuckerburg headhunted to be chief programmer for ambitious entrepreneurs and athlete twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss Armie Hammer and their associate Divya Narendra Max Minghella The trio ask Zuckerberg to help them build a Social Networking Website called Harvard Connection one of many notions suggested as a potential forerunner for the Facebook concept the similarity of the sites leads the twins and Narendra to press for legal charges after Facebook explodes in popularity The second and more interesting of the depositions focuses on the creation and rise of Facebook as well as the relationship of co founders Mark Zuckerburg and Eduardo Saverin played by Andrew Garfield It is here we are also introduced to Justin Timberlake s smooth talking portrayal of Sean Parker who attempts to muscle in on the Facebook frenzy As mentioned earlier the inner workings nature and strength of the relationships are inspected by Fincher and the cast here So what did I like Well the cast does a sound job with the nicely calculated script Eisenberg and Garfield are the highlights for me both manage to bring conviction and whit to their roles In addition those who indulge in Facebook themselves will enjoy seeing how the site along with many of it s intricacies were conceived also there is much to relate within the film s references to how the site has impacted peoples lives and created new social behaviours On the flip side the subject matter is ultimately more captivating than it s subjects who for the most part are reflective of over privileged American youth culture The climax of the movie is pretty unremarkable and lacks any true climactic tension With that said it s not enough to detract from what is a solid project guided by fine work from all involved which should be a largely inclusive viewing experience for movie goers and Facebook lovers a like Go see it 7 10,7
15 December 2019,thoughts on the social network,I personally really enjoyed The Social Network it was able to tell the story of Facebook without becoming boring When films are based around certain real life event they can sometimes be too scared to stray too far from the facts which can make the film end up being boring and too realistic if people wanted that they would look for documentaries The Social Network pretty much keeps to the story line of creating Facebook without feeling to much like a documentary The script dialogue you can tell just by watching the first scene with Mark and his girlfriend Erica Jesse Eisenberg especially captures the tone personality of his character just by his execution of his lines fast pace I found the scenes where they were arguing in the meeting a little confusing and erratic but other than that this movie is able to keep to entertained while giving you real insight of the story of Facebook,10
11 January 2020,GREAT PERFORMANCES.,David Fincher knows how to craft his movies Well written characters that feel genuine help to give the film a greater personality and make it more memorable Great job,9
30 April 2023,"Much more about the Facebook creation, it is an intelligent premise that is very efficient in its proposal to analyze human relations in the 21st century",Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin dramatizes here the events that led Mark Zuckerberg played by Jesse Eisenberg to create what is currently the largest social network on the planet and perhaps the most accessed website on the internet after Google We re thrown in 2004 on Harvard College where Zuckerberg has just broken up with his girlfriend Erica Rooney Mara who simply can t take any more of his arrogance and difficult temper The breakup leads Zuckerberg to get drunk and distract himself with some internet experiment where he hacks all the college s servers to create a student ranking game something that in a few hours brings down the system and puts Mark on the board This also attracts the attention of twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss both played by Armie Hammer and his partner Divya Narendra Max Minghella who invite him to help create an exclusive social network for Harvard faculty However Mark ends up taking the concept and developing it into something more complex taking the lead with the launch of his The Facebook which quickly becomes the big sensation on campus and expands to other universities schools and even countries With the help of his best friend Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield Mark continues to monetize the site and start his own company which provokes the wrath of the Winklevoss twins who set out to confront him in the courts and also the evil eye of the ambitious entrepreneur Sean Parker Justin Timberlake All these events will put Mark in a whirlwind of business conflicts and enmities while we are trying to understand what is most important to him From the synopsis it is already clear that it is a somewhat more complex premise than the mere creation of a website so this definitely frees us from the erroneous first impression of this being Facebook The Movie What we have in place is an intelligent work that is very efficient in its proposal to analyze human relations in the 21st century marked by virtual interactivity the aggressive tactics of entrepreneurial business and the desire to be accepted that plagues the protagonist of the story What we see in The Social Network is Zuckerberg s effort to create a world in which he could be socially relevant Fincher s work however shows how this effort came at a cost Not by chance the achievement of a billion users on Facebook takes place in a scene in which after the celebration the protagonist appears completely isolated from the rest of the characters The attempt to use the virtual to reach the real proves to be a failure which ends up isolating Mark even more from a social life considered normal Fincher has been working on this differentiation between the real and the virtual since the beginning of the feature As Zuckerberg creates Facemash the montage alternates between his isolated project in his bedroom on the university campus with a frat party While the clubs the boy never managed to get into live their routine parties he ends up creating his own sculpting his virtual world as revenge on the class that doesn t embrace him The character s need for approval is reflected in all of his relationships While Zuckerberg is extremely attached to virtual life his best and only friend Saverin transits between the two worlds but always tending to keep his feet in reality Wardo as he is known is a cool guy who is about to be accepted into one of Harvard s most prestigious clubs something that obviously arouses his friend s envy But while Wardo partner and co founder of Facebook struggles in the real world to make the company grow Mark ends up approaching the only figure in the film who in fact transits between the virtual and the real quite easily Sean Parker Justin Timberlake creator of the controversial Napster Parker gives Mark a new and different view on the modernity of business and the possibilities of Facebook however he only aims to use the virtual to be relevant in the real world The character wants to take revenge on old enemies and celebrate with women and drugs with the gains that may arise His attitudes however cause discomfort and break the relationship between Mark and Eduardo taking them to court The film s sophisticated narrative structure which will constantly intersperse Mark s actions starting Facebook with the two legal processes that followed after the site s launch and popularization Such a decision requires a lot of attention from the viewer as a small amount of information can be delivered with a quick cut if flashbacks usually yield longer sequences Sorkin s technique coupled with the perfect editing work of Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall often takes us back in time just so we can hear a single comment from any of the characters It s a radical style that guarantees an even more frenetic and dynamic language to Sorkin s fluid text never leaving the viewer tired and giving us the virtual experience of what it s like to be inside the head of Mark Zuckerberg who from the first scene makes his life hell Girlfriend for always keeping parallel subjects within the same dialogue And even if I don t fully like the idea I don t deny that time jumps represent an efficient version of the zapping effect that we perform when surfing different sites on the internet and absorbing different contents at the same time but we ll dive into that later Sorkin s mastery also extends to the creation of characters who even when dealing with real figures gain a necessary dramatization to make them more captivating figures so a need to be true to real life isn t exactly a need the real Sean Parker himself stated that he was nothing bad boy as the movie portrays him for example Truthfulness aside all of Sorkin s characters get an impeccable treatment and fervent dialogues that are able to differentiate their personalities Mark s arrogance Sean s soft speech and Eduardo s loyalty are strong characteristics there and Sorkin is successful in writing dialogues that reinforce the friendship of the protagonists in a natural way bringing something very powerful and sad to the moment of destruction The way he presents the entrepreneur played by Justin Timberlake is also a lesson in scriptwriting and introduction since just like the initial dialogue between Mark and Erica it tells us everything we need to know about the character he wakes up without clothes on in a college student played by Dakota Johnson before Fifty Shades of Grey without remembering her name or the context of the situation only to reverse the situation in a matter of minutes through her speech and intelligence Questions like Do I have your attention and Are you listening to what I m saying come up a couple of times At the end of the day while Facebook is all about connectivity David Fincher is making a film about dissonance It s like the noise that lingers in Reznor s trail literally and metaphorically The Social Network is not the judicial discussion about who had the idea to create Facebook or even what end it all took This theme is used as a backdrop to discuss human relations in times when humanity and its real contact seems to have less and less value in a world dominated by the market of symbolic values in which it is more important to appear than to what to be It is more important to show what you are doing than to really enjoy the moment changing even the meaning of the human experience Fincher and Sorkin help us not only to understand a little more about our times and the people who live in them but also to understand ourselves within that context Maybe a little more than we d like If we focus our attention on the final scene of the work it is interesting to observe how Fincher transforms Mark s relationship with the F5 into tragedy We only see the character at his computer trying to approach a woman who worked at the trial Her refusal is like the final nail in the coffin of tragedy for the character who begs for any human connection At the end of The Social Network the protagonist seems to understand the weight of his choices The Zuckerberg in the film has destroyed all of his real ties his girlfriend his best friend college in favor of his project to create a parallel world What the film makes clear however is that no one can live exclusively on digital The billions of profiles on Facebook only exist because behind them there are real people managing them at least in most cases All that s left for Mark is to try to connect with his ex girlfriend through the world he s created knowing deep down that he s more distant from her than ever This is Fincher s most subdued film and also the best of his career but it s not because we don t have some of his usual mannerisms that this film becomes less Fincher His presence is felt in the perfect fluidity of the scenes which reach an unprecedented level of aesthetic and dramaturgical perfection partly in the repeated times that the director records a take which results in the surgical improvement of each action touch or speech The Social Network is perhaps the perfect example of how a movie can subvert expectations It s a powerful character study fueled by Aaron Sorkin s absolutely flawless screenplay and David Fincher s superb direction who understands her subtleties and pushes her talented cast to explore areas full of nuance and hidden detail The saga of Mark Zuckerberg and the creation of his revolutionary Facebook can now have its place certified in history given the mastery of cinematic language and the efficiency with which it tells a story that at first glance may seem banal and without much room for reflections In fact we are still facing the best film of the last decade,8
23 February 2021,The Social Experiment,I don t like Facebook and I generally don t care for Eisenberg but wow do I love this movie An exceptional story of a brilliant jerk and the people that have to deal with him As a fictionalized biopic of Zuckerberg s creation of Facebook and it s inevitable rocket ride to infamy I ll leave it at that so the uninitiated can experience it fresh Exceptional performances from sometimes unlikely sources looking at you Timberlake and great cinematography It s just an all around spectacular film that everyone should really check out,9
8 December 2010,TheFacebook will go to TheOscars,You know what s cooler than a million dollars A billion dollars How in the world do you make a two hour film about the invention of facebook and make it an engaging thriller The answer is pretty simple get David Fincher to direct the film and Aaron Sorkin to write the screenplay Fincher is one of the best modern day directors who seems to turn everything he touches into gold I don t think I was alone in the opinion that making a movie about Facebook was a bad idea I just thought it would be impossible to keep the viewers interested for two hours on a computer nerd at most it would be decent material for a short film But once I heard Fincher was involved with the project I totally bought into the idea Fincher has proved himself with such great films as Se7en Fight Club Zodiac and Benjamin Button and with the Social Network he has created one of the best modern biopics I have seen He will surely be nominated for best director and the film will also garnish several other nominations including best picture Sorkin A Few Good Men Charlie Wilson s War should also be credited for the success of the film because his screenplay was perfect it will also be nominated for best adapted screenplay you can count on it He creates such great characters that are far from being one dimensional You have Mark Zuckerberg played by Jesse Eisenberg from Zombieland and Adventureland fame who is sort of a jerk incapable of being social a real intelligent and arrogant guy but who you end up routing for because let s face it he invented facebook one of our favorite vices on the internet The guy may not have any social skills but he is a genius and there is always something attractive about geniuses We can forgive him because he is just so wicked smart but I don t think any one of us would want to be his friends or much less stand anyone like that His only friend Eduardo Saverin played by Andrew Garfield the soon to be Peter Parker in the new Spider Man franchise is also a student in Harvard who seems to be the only person who stands Mark even though he is treated cruelly at times but he is good at keeping his composure and hiding his emotions Eduardo and Mark found the company Thefacebook com together which begins exclusively for Harvard students but begins to spread to other schools Sean Parker played by Justin Timberlake hears about the website and arranges a meeting with Mark and Eduardo foreseeing the potential the site has Sean happens to be the inventor of Napster and unlike Mark he is very social and expressive The characters seem to complement each other and it all works to perfection The film is non linear as we jump back and forth from Harvard to the law suits that Mark is going through once he has become a billionaire He is being sued by his best friend Eduardo which makes the viewer wonder what has gone wrong with their relationship and on the other hand by the Winklevoss twin brothers who actually suggested the idea for an exclusive Harvard site and claim Mark stole it from them Mark was always obsessed about getting into Final Clubs in College and when the twin brothers came to him with the idea about a Harvard exclusive site everything clicked for him He could be the president of his own exclusive site He was a visionary and everything paid off for him We lived in farms then we lived in cities and now we re gonna live on the internet The Social Network is a modern day biopic full of thrills thanks to a great script and a good performance from the cast especially by Andrew Garfield The score is also great and contributes to the overall story as well as the filming which is just brilliant The rowing scenes were beautifully shot but they weren t just there for artistic purposes The entire rowing scenario with the twins was sort of a parable of how they were used to being first all the time When they finally lose to the Dutch they realize that being second brings no reward Zuckerberg beat them at coming up with the idea for Facebook perhaps a little unethically on his part but the difference between being first and second in the business world is gigantic no matter how tight the race is Fincher has directed a great film and will probably get a lot of recognition during award season because he was able to transmit the importance of our modern day internet age Fincher should be considering making a sequel to this film about the founders of Twitter nah maybe that is a really bad idea Anyway The Social Network is my favorite biopic this year and finally brought down The Runaways to second place It s all about being first that s what makes the difference http estebueno10 blogspot com,9
17 January 2022,There should be a movie about erica,Erica Albright should ve been the main character honestly They should make a movie about a woman dealing with douchebags like mark It was uncomfortable to watch it The misogyny the only line I liked was the erica says to mark about him not getting girl because he s an assh0le,1
27 January 2011,Iconic,When Mark Zuckerberg s friend Eduardo pointedly put forwards his point to Mr Zuckerberg while testifying for his claims of corporate embezzlement by Mr Zuckerberg that he was his only friend and that his facebook friend s list are worthless you realize the time s that we live in where each one of us has created a virtual world for ourselves to satisfy our social needs We have an apparent friends list of over 200 to 400 friends but fail to realize we are sitting in our room all alone These are the fine intimate scenes and moments in the movie The Social Network that makes you feel that this has got something to do with how you lead your life is what makes this movie an iconic movie of the first decade of the 21st century Directed by the always underrated Mr David Fincher of Fight Club Seven Zodiac and The curious case of Benjamin Button this is the movie that should fetch him an Oscar and for everyone involved with this movie The Social Network relives the story of the creation of a website and company which defines this generation from a college dorm room The controversial natures of its creation notwithstanding the movie without taking sides tells the tale honestly and with great compose The controversial co founder of Facebook and the main protagonist character of the movie Mark Zuckerberg played by Jesse Eisenberg seems to have his own story to tell about friendship which is ironic since he is more or less controlling the social lives of millions of people As a Harvard under graduate student Mark was on the sidelines of the Harvard s social scene when he decides to do something substantial to get attention after his girlfriend breaks up with him His little website about comparing woman s face with each other draws lot of attention and a suspension but also leads him to the Winklevoss twins who have an idea of a social networking site exclusive for people with mailing ID of harward edu Till that step things are smooth but soon takes the turn to controversial with each side having its own versions of the story of a time in their lives that would change social networking forever As Mr Zuckerberg went on to create the facebook along with his other roommates he starts grabbing attention from girls who normally would ignore him But as he expands his website to other colleges the website grabs the attention of Napster founder and recently bankrupted Sean Parker who takes facebook to a new level and isolates Mark from his best friend and co founder of facebook Eduardo who is a business major and had made the early investments for the website What we see in the movie is the side by side hearings of two lawsuits against Mr Zuckerberg One from the Winklevoss twins for stealing their idea and another from Mark s former best friend Eduardo for deceitful dilution of Eduardo s business share in the company The director pitches the story towards the audience without judgment against any individual The razor sharp dialogues of the screenplay are used to pull the audiences in the conversation between characters that are sometimes highly technical but thanks to writer Aaron Sorkin not out of reach of the general public The great casting cannot be described in any more way except giving a standout mention to Jesse Eisenberg who played Mark Zuckerberg In times of heartbreaks he made a generation felt his angst and in times of defending himself he let the world sympathize feel he was a cheat as well as admire his genius Speaking about how this generation felt about Mark Zuckerberg s portrayal in the film it is very much felt it reflected something more to them than the older generation His was a story of great entrepreneur success in this capitalist world A socially viable invention that is of some need to all and still all what it is to him is a business a commanding position that a generation craves to be at this age and also to be the youngest billionaire in the world That he treated women like farm animals or the movie as a whole treated women like meat meant nothing to the audience He found success in this dog eat dog world and is sitting on top of the pile His success made him friendless at least in the movie was not a matter of concern since last check his facebook page has 2 912 375 friends And as in the final moments of the movie as Mark sits in front of his laptop while sending a friend s request to a special long lost girl and as he sits through clicking the refresh button waiting for a reply to the request it defines a generation that is including Mark is waiting for one thing in society acceptance,10
22 December 2010,It's hard to make a film about geeks Oscar material.,There is talk of The Social Network being up for quite a few nominations at next years Oscars and while i can appreciate the writing and the acting involved in this film i cant quite see how this is being talked up for an academy Award You would think the story of how Facebook evolved would not be the most exhilarating subject for a movie and in a way it s true but it s not a boring film in a way shape or form It only takes a few geeks and a great idea to make someone a billionaire and they don t even have to be interesting people or even nice and the portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg in this makes him neither of those but what it does show is that when big money starts to be made friendship goes out of the window and the Lawyers start to make their wedge There are good performances from Andrew Garfield Jesse Eisenberg and Justin Timberlake but not enough for this film to get close to winning best picture award Perhaps it shows what a a poor year it has been for movies if this even gets nominated It s still worth watching though There is talk of The Social Network being up for quite a few nominations at next years Oscars and while i can appreciate the writing and the acting involved in this film i cant quite see how this is being talked up for an academy Award You would think the story of how Facebook evolved would not be the most exhilarating subject for a movie and in a way it s true but it s not a boring film in a way shape or form It only takes a few geeks and a great idea to make someone a billionaire and they don t even have to be interesting people or even nice and the portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg in this makes him neither of those but what it does show is that when big money starts to be made friendship goes out of the window and the Lawyers start to make their wedge There are good performances from Andrew Garfield Jesse Eisenberg and Justin Timberlake but not enough for this film to get close to winning best picture award Perhaps it shows what a a poor year it has been for movies if this even gets nominated It s still worth watching though,7
24 May 2020,Brilliant,It s intellectually very interesting you can learn a lot of the Facebook founding process,10
5 April 2019,"For all intents and purposes of the film, Eisenberg is on the mark.",David Fincher s internet epic is an incisively written and impressively controlled biopic where captivating legal drama meets new media ambition Jesse Eisenberg exudes a scary confidence and insensitivity in this relentless character study,9
13 January 2019,This is the 2010 Oscar season's first drama to live up to the hype and expectations associated with it.,David Fincher s internet epic is an incisively written and impressively controlled biopic where captivating legal drama meets new media ambition Jesse Eisenberg exudes a scary confidence and insensitivity in this relentless character study,9
8 August 2019,Fincher's Masterpiece,The Social Network is a generation defining film one that only comes around so often telling a mostly true story about something that has effected a multitude of people from every varying demographic I can t go on to say if this is David Fincher s best movie to date but it s easily his most poignant and relative even almost a decade later The Social Network is even more provocative and relevent than it was in 2010 Through the power of film David Fincher gives us an important history lesson while being wildly entertaining funny and intense focusing on and mastering his craft solidifying his aesthetic for future projects to come The performances are intense intricate and spot on each one specifically written with their own agenda there s nothing sloppy about Aaron Sorkin s writing it s fast it s exciting and it s just plain great David Fincher has been pushing boundaries through his filmography but The Social Network is where he fully breaks through Creating his dense atmosphere with beautiful stylish cinematography with a masterfully perfect ethereal score from two masters of the music industry The Social Network not only stands the test of time but proves that it only makes this film more important while the age of technology is ever growing I give The Social Network 5 stars out of 5,10
17 January 2011,"Thoroughly engrossing film about the origins of Facebook, the players behind it, and the reasons for the lawsuits that arose from its birth.",Brilliant I loved the pacing the music the acting and more definitely one of the year s best The dialogue and characters are unusual fascinating appealing yet also somewhat repellent in their brilliance We get a glimpse into the challenge of being a genius at the expense of social graces but it s also that detachment from caring that provides some of the sharpest verbal comebacks Stinging in their truthfulness what normally might be left unsaid is a joy to see spoken with such disdain conviction If you have any bit of entrepreneurial spirit you will be inspired by this movie It s invigorating to see the incredible potential of one brilliant idea mixed with timing and understanding it s growth mechanisms so as not to ruin the potential Also important is the underlying message that poor business decisions and dishonesty will most likely bite you in the butt The bigger the business the bigger the dogs chasing you,9
19 September 2023,Remains an engaging movie more than ten years after its release,It s a biopic of Mark Zuckerberg set from 2003 2009 in Cambridge Massachusetts and Palo Alto California It follows Zuckerberg s creation of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg an undergrad at Harvard is a programming genius with negligible social skills His girlfriend Erica Rooney Mara breaks up with him and he retaliates by negatively blogging about her and setting up a website that rates female students at Harvard That site s success crashes the Harvard servers and attracts the attention of the wealthy Winklevoss twins Armie Hammer who are working on a social network for Harvard students Zuckerberg agrees to program for them but instead creates his own site called The Facebook with financial support from his roommate and best friend Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield Eventually Sean Parker Justin Timberlake the earlier creator of the music sharing site Napster becomes involved and encourages Zuckerberg to think much bigger and take the company to California Parker s involvement leads to battles for the company s soul and legal disputes between Zuckerberg Saverin and the Winklevoss twins The Social Network remains an engaging movie more than ten years after its release It makes villains of both Zuckerberg and Parker and hints at the social networking dominance that Facebook would achieve The film cleverly intersperses legal hearings among the parties that reflect how the law uses minor details from one s life to build legal arguments If one doesn t like Mark Zuckerberg you probably enjoyed the movie though its historical accuracy is open to some debate The Social Network seems similar to how Aaron Sorkin who wrote the script would portray Elon Musk,8
18 November 2010,"A good movie, but let's not get ahead of ourselves",I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,8
28 December 2010,"Unexpectedly a very powerful film, sure to be a major contender at the 2011 Oscars.",The social network is a masterpiece in many ways It opens with one of the best written scenes in history the break up of Mark Zuckerberg the soon to be creator of a 25 billion dollar website Jesse Eisenberg from Zombieland who is perfectly cast with Erika This leads to a long night of laptop use for Zuckerberg and in this night he creates Facemash a website that received somewhat 20 000 hits in 2 hours It is then where Zuckerberg finds his talent and works on an idea that today is facebook With his best friend Eduardo a thrilling and empathic debut performance from newcomer Andrew Garfield financing Facebook is born As the site becomes more popular and wealthy and when Sean Parker Justin Timberlake don t judge him from his singing career he s a good actor joins the team the stakes become higher and betrayal success and billions of dollars are what is to follow Brilliant performances from Eisenberg Garfield and Timberlake David Fincher The Curious case of Benjamin Button s masterfully simplistic direction and Aaron Sorkin creator and screenwriter of TV s The West Wing s amazing screenplay make The Social Network truly a film for our times relevant for many reasons the biggest being Facebook is probably one of the top 10 words you would use to describe this decade It seems that the end of the decade has brought the best films Just this year we have been privileged with Inception The ghost writer and this reviewed title just to name a few I strongly suspect no I KNOW that The Social Network will be a huge contender at 2011 s Academy Awards Also do not judge this film as garbage simply because it s about facebook The central points are what wealth and fame can do to people and betrayal of friendship to achieve these goals A very good drama 9 10,9

30 April 2020,"Incredible movie, David Fincher is a genius!",This film is one of the best in the career of director David Fincher What an impeccable script I m at a loss for words to describe this incredible script Not to mention the great performances of the actors in addition to the excellent direction The Social Network is an example of a film to be followed,10
24 June 2011,"Stylish but Vapid, Pretentious, Much Ado....",I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,5
26 June 2022,Quality movie!,David Fincher s movies always have a style flavor to them with his cinematography lighting but what really shines in this movie is how it progresses and the performances This movie made me like Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield much more for sure who s super talented with his emotional scenes The dramatic moments were shocking and while much of the plot was no entirely accurate relating to real life events the movie was still very good for what it ended up being While it lost me in a couple of parts the good great parts were all it needed with the good great acting,8
8 October 2010,"If you love Facebook, you'll ""Like"" this movie...",After seeing this 2 hour drama about the man who founded the most popular social networking site in the world I think this movie deserves a chance to win some Oscar bait The cinematography soundtrack casting and script of the movie is pretty well done It s a big step up from Fincher s previous film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button which was a disappointment to die hard fans who consider Fight Club Seven Panic Room and Zodiac as some of his finest work The Social Network is more than just a movie about Facebook It s about the young men and women who created a behemoth that exploded beyond their wildest dreams It s great for people who are not even Facebook users Highly recommended,10
6 June 2017,brilliantly entertaining and unique,David Fincher has proved that any premise can be made great with the help of a hardworking and ingenious film crew and cast The miracle Fincher has achieved in this film is the morphing of a concept that could have more easily been turned into a made for T V snoozefest painfully catering to a younger audience into a witty and challenging drama From my point of view those who believe that this film is on the side of any of its characters is surely mistaken Many critical reviews do not seem to be criticizing the film but the film s subjects when that is honestly not the way to go The film itself is mostly neutral when portraying its cast of characters portraying them as the fascinating and flawed beings they truly are Almost everyone in this movie is for lack of a better word kind of a d ck Zuckerberg is among film history s most complex characters an excruciatingly intelligent man with an endless capability of technological genius but he is also a man who hurts and betrays others including those closest to him He is borderline narcissistic in his ways and yet again I fail to come up with a better word often comes across as no more than the standard annoying Harvard smartass Its a film about the forces of evil friendship love destiny inspiration greed business conflict and so on and son Rapid fire laugh out loud dialogue is constantly exchanged through one of the most well written and ingenious film scripts of all time Fincher adapts the boundlessly brilliant script in the best way possible by incorporating his fine visual flare and knack for perfectly paced editing Seriously I find this to be among the finest edited films of all time The editing is able to communicate the feelings of chaos and disorientation throughout without giving the viewer a headache and entertainment is never sacrificed for Fincher proves that eh can make any situation as engaging as it possibly can be Each and every crucial element of cinema is utilized in the best way possible in The Social Network Each performance is pitch perfect Jesse Eisenberg Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake all provide some of the finest film performances of the past decade the editing as I have already stated is unbearably incredible the pacing is highly well done the subject matter is handled in a way that is mature but not at all devoid of humor the visuals are beautiful the soundtrack is amazing the script is among the greatest ever written and the film functions as one of the most fascinating and complicated character studies I have ever witnessed The film offers no easy answers and begs for audiences to think about and question the characters morals flaws and capabilities as well as their own,9
13 February 2011,Very thought-provoking and real,I d like to give this at least an 8 5 Maybe one day IMDb will implement a system that allows decimals Oh well Honestly I thought this movie would be underwhelming just because many of us know the gist of the story I underestimated the creators and actors because this was a very well done film all around I m all about court room dramas and internet culture separately and it s all blended well here The actors are all pretty much unknown to me but I enjoyed just about everyone and no one was clich or distracting All were believable The movie is never boring either so I appreciated the deliberate and consistent pace Going back and forth from the evolution of the site to the law suits was done perfectly I m not really sure why I really liked but didn t love it There s virtually nothing wrong with it Maybe it s just because Facebook is such a part of our culture nowadays that it seemed old hat before it even began Not sure but the movie succeeds on all fronts in my opinion Some people here don t seem to understand that this is based on real life If the characters seem cold or boring to you that s just because their portrayals are based on people that exhibited that kind of personality It s not about what you want out of a story they re just showing you how past events unfolded I don t want it twisted into a story that s only about two friends who split apart or something I just want to hear the story as it is So many reviews ask why it wasn t about this or that The answer is because it s about what happened not what you want to see I thought this was obvious but apparently not,8
8 September 2022,Fincher + Sorkin = Masterpiece,The Social Network was the first film I watched that was purely dialogue driven It was also my introduction to David Fincher I was young so I didn t quite understand everything that was being said But I was just so captivated Many people say The Social Network is about Facebook it s not It s about Ambition betrayal friendship greed It uses the creation of Facebook as the story to convey those themes Of course you have Fincher s signature perfectionist filmmaking as well as Aaron Sorkin s witty Shakespearean dialogue Which I said before is incredibly captivating The score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is one of my favorites I consider this to be the quintessential film of the 2010 s It s one of the main films that got me into cinema,10
27 March 2022,Fincher doing facebook,I ve heard a lot of positive things about The Social Network and it looked like a really interesting film Fincher has made some of the most popular and respected and beloved films of all time such as Fight Club Gone Girl Se7en and Zodiac but this is different than all his others with it s themes about greed class portrayal friendship and loyalty This is probably Fincher s least dated film despite being released 12 years ago it doesn t feel like a period piece The Social Network isn t a story just about a social media site it s about friendship and trust and about how you can lose something just from a lie David Fincher s direction is phenomenal in this movie with his subtle nuances and incredible cinematography I mean this is one of the most beautiful and most stylish David Fincher movies The Social Network draws you in from the very first frame to the last my eyes were glued to the screen for almost the entire runtime and the screenplay is one of the best this is a masterclass in storytelling showing another side of how Facebook was created even though Zuckerberg himself said that it wasn t all right Jesse Eisenberg Andrew Garfield Armie Hammer and Justin Timberlake all give some of the best performances I ve seen from them their performances are heartbreaking and the musical score is fantastic the themes in the movie elevated it from good to great this is probably Fincher s most different movie he s ever made it s not a thriller or a crime movie and it s probably the best biopic I ve ever seen I m gonna give The Social Network an A,9
19 December 2010,"Its David Fincher's smart direction, Aaron Sorkin's sharp screenplay & Brilliant performances by the ensemble young cast which made the movie what it has become today!",THE SOCIAL NETWORK CATCH IT A Undoubtedly The Social Network is the most fascinating movie of 2010 In the beginning it was hard for me to get grip of the movie as the dialogues are really fast smart clever between Jesse Eisenberg Mark Rooney Mara Erika and then there was three things happened simultaneously A Harvard College life two case proceedings Once I got the grip of the movie after 15minutes then I actually started to enjoy it plus I realize how smart the writing direction and editing have been done Every scene dialogue actor comes on screen are captivating Its David Fincher s smart direction Aaron Sorkin s sharp screenplay Brilliant performances by the ensemble young cast which made the movie what it has become today Now let s talk about wonderful performances by talented young cast Jesse Eisenberg Mark Zuckerberg I ve always found Jesse one note of an actor who plays geek or dorky and always acts the same in every movie ever since Cursed Horror Adventurland coming of age comedy or Zombieland Thriller Comedy but this is the first time he plays genius evil jealous liar manipulative geek with utmost perfection I think it was a huge huge jump from his previous performances In every scene he was so convincing in whatever he says does that you actually believe that he is the ultimate evil genius I truly wish he gets the Oscar nod because he justly deserves it Andrew Garfield Eduardo Saverin When I heard Andrew Garfield signed on to play Spider Man I ve got my hands on his previous notable works and I saw Boy A he was superb in the movie I loved his performance so much that I started watching his other movies like The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus Red Riding In the Year of Our Lord 1974 In all his previous movies he was Brilliant Now in The Social Network he again proved that he is superbly talented the ultimate British talented lad in Hollywood His performance is so brilliant in the movie that I was actually rotting for him the entire time and hated Jesse Eisenberg Mark Zuckerberg Andrew Garfield will defiantly get an Oscar nod for his honest portrayal Armie Hemmer Cameron Winklevoss Tyler Winklevoss Josh Pence Tyler Winklevoss Armie Hemmer got me do WOW every single time he was on screen he was par excellence I remember Armie Hemmer through his stint on Gossip Girl at that time I found him very mature for his age and the reason was his strong voice and looks Now after watching The Social Network I have realized how good actually his voice is and that it actually made the Winklevoss Twins so strong believable 6 5 foot tall I think Armie Hemmer should get big rewards for his performance as both Twins Josh Pence was the Blonde Winklevoss body but later on digitally they put Armie s face on his body Still I am mentioning him here because he deserved to be mentioned Justin Timberlake Sean Parker Justin Timberlake was great in 5 seconds you completely forget that he is JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE he becomes Sean Parker only I loved how confidently he acted as Sean parker who is fast mean cunning No wonder he is been getting so many accolades for his portrayal Max Minghella Divya Narendra Max has relatively small part as compare to all other actors but still he was significant part of the whole story He was natural as always Rooney Mara Erica Albright Rooney Mara was Amazing strong and Sharp She was in the first Break up scene and then came for two more scenes only and still she leaves a strong impact I loved her expressions where she finds out Mark has written awful things about her on his blog She was flawless can t wait to see her as Lisbeth Salander in David Fincher s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Brenda Song Christy Lee Brenda Song was hot adorable nothing like London Tipton of The Suite Life on Deck I pleasantly surprise to see her in such adult role defiantly want to see her more Loved her Dakota Johnson Amelia Ritter Malese Jow Alice Cantwel Rashida Jones Marylin Delpy Joseph Mazzello Dustin Moskovitz Patrick Mapel Chris Hughes and Trevor Wright Josh Thompson They were young Hot simple as that Overall a fascinating true story told in a fascinating captivating way A must see by everyone who is addicted to Facebook or not A sure Oscar contender Winner Inception Black Swan can have a hard time,10
30 August 2018,I Feel the Same Way about This Move as I do about FaceBook,An admittedly great film that I found both annoying and boring I have never been a fan of Jesse Eisenberg or Mark Zuckerberg I tried really hard to enjoy this but I just could bring myself to Still there are a lot of great scenes Personal Enjoyment Score IMDb 3 10 Movie Score LetterBoxd 8 10,3
22 October 2010,Surprisingly deep and moving film,I think the majority of people were very skeptical upon hearing that a film was to be made regarding the invention of everyone s favourite social network site Facebook Such a film sounds like a quick cash in aimed at today s youth who live part of their lives through the said website however when David Fight Club Fincher was announced as director I immediately became intrigued Fincher is in my eyes one of the best directors around and his attachment to a film ensures it will be entertaining yet deep He s proved this with his past projects and this is exactly how I would describe The Social Network I ll admit I have a Facebook account although I had no idea who created it or how it was created The Social Network tells the story of how Mark Zuckerberg a Harvard University student comes up with the idea of Facebook and the ensuing legal battles he faces Now since seeing the film I have learnt that much of the film is in fact an exaggeration of the truth but what film isn t these days The Social Network begins with Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg being dumped by his girlfriend Erica in a bar where they had visited to just have a drink You learn a lot about Zuckerberg in this scene how he is a complete ass yet simply wants to have friends and be recognised as having friends In retaliation to the actions of his ex Zuckerberg returns to his dorm and creates a website called FaceMash where Harvard female students are rated against one another based solely on levels of attraction Zuckerberg creates FashMash in one evening alone whilst intoxicated although he is aided by several friends including Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield who supplies him with an algorithm necessary to allow the site to function properly and it is this feat along with the fact that the Harvard network crashes due to the amount of traffic on FaceMash that alert Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss to Zuckerberg s talents They hire Zuckerberg to create a social network site called The Harvard Connection which Zuckerberg agrees to However he then approaches Eduardo with idea of Thefacebook a site where Harvard students can see information regarding each other without invading privacy Zuckerberg asks Eduardo to put up 1 000 dollars to set up the site which he will create Eduardo agrees and Zuckerberg quickly creates the site that becomes an instant hit across campus During this time Zuckerberg avoids any meetings with the Winklevoss however they eventually become aware that Zuckerberg is the creator of Thefacebook and claim that he stole their IP Meanwhile Thefacebook expands to schools across the US and comes to the attention of Napster co founder Sean Parker Justin Timberlake who arranges a meeting with Zuckerberg and Eduardo Zuckerberg is impressed with Parker whilst Eduardo notes his unprofessional past and is skeptical of him in general No deal is reached with Parker though he recommends that they drop The from the site calling it simply Facebook which is taken up by Zuckerberg The decision is then taken by Zuckerberg to move the base of operation to Palo Alto while Eduardo remains in the East trying to secure investment through advertising When Eduardo shows up at Palo Alto he is enraged that Parker is living with the Facebook team and making business decisions while Eduardo is ignored Zuckerberg then agrees to a decision whereby Parker is given 7 share of Facebook and Eduardo s ownership is reduced from 30 to less than 1 Eduardo then decides to sue Zuckerberg whilst Parker and Facebook interns are arrested for possession of cocaine at a party Throughout the film we see Zuckerberg testifying in the two lawsuits Winklevoss and Eduardo s and the finale sees a junior lawyer inform Zuckerberg that his defence team will recommend a settlement agreement with Eduardo and she suggests that he settles The film ends with Zuckerberg sending Erica his ex a friend request and waiting for her to reply I must say that all the performances in this film are fantastic something that deserves recognition considering the cast are all quite young Eisenberg steals the show as Zuckerberg portraying a troubled youth with immense talent that as Eduardo recognises needs looking after Timberlake puts in an admirable performance as sleazy Parker and I think he deserves some respect for playing a character that really isn t supposed to be liked in the movie This isn t a happy movie there s some jokes but generally you will leave the cinema somewhat downbeat This is a film about how friendships are destroyed and how people are manipulated The audience are probably most sympathetic to Eduardo he was a consultant for the movie whilst no Facebook employee Zuckerberg included had anything to do with it perhaps this has some bearing on the telling of the story he tries to do the right thing and look out for Zuckerberg but Zuckerberg s treatment of him leads him to being kicked out of the Facebook team Fincher s direction is superb a memorable scene being the Henley Regatta featuring the Winklevoss boat race which I would like to watch again The film is very relevant right now as Facebook is huge and still growing and it is impressive what has been achieved in a film regarding such a subject I can guarantee that you won t be disappointed with The Social Network and it ranks up there with Fincher s best,8
17 December 2010,"A film not about Facebook, but the face of the guys behind the book",The Social Network is a great film and it does deserve all the credit it s getting The key is in how Sorkin crafted the story and the characters and then how the actors ably portrayed those characters This isn t about Facebook but more the guys or guy who invented it And the way Sorkin presented these characters was perfect I was never very sure about exactly what Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg was like but I could quickly get a handle on everybody around him Eduardo Andrew Garfield the Winklevoss twins Armie Hammer and Divya Narendra Max Minghella They represented Harvard students and they represented them accurately I was particularly impressed with Garfield He was the slightly awkward loner the caring friend the ambitious businessman and the revengeful scorned friend but most importantly by the end he was the one who I had to see through to get to the real Mark Zuckerberg Originally I had said that Mark Ruffalo was my vote for Best Supporting Actor but I might have to retract that statement It s now Garfield And of course Aaron Sorkin for Best Adapted Screenplay This film wouldn t have been much without the incredible and interesting dynamics that Sorkin created Upon it s initial release I was quite put off because they basically marketed it as A movie about Facebook starring Michael Cera and brought to you by the director of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button What about that statement would make me want to see this film They should have tried something like A film not about Facebook but the face of the guys behind the book Written by Aaron Sorkin There Columbia Pictures 18 free words for you I want to say The Social Network is the best college film ever made but that is such a negative genre and I don t mean to insult the film that way,10
29 January 2011,"The Social Network, was a great network of success.",You know many people are always skeptical when there is a movie where it involves a website or a certain or based on something involving this society we live in The reason people don t think this movie could work is because it is based on the global phenomenon facebook I in all honestly don t become skeptical towards these types of films I personally believed that this film has a huge chance at winning at least one Oscar this year Either for best picture best actor or best supporting actor Jesse Eisenburg was spectacular at portraying the genius and or just a crazy kid willing to do anything to do what he thinks is right Justin Timberlake was also good this was probably his best film Unlike his other films Justin was serious and top notch at his role as the creator of Napster Sean Parker but the actor who was absolutely perfect was Andrew Garfield Garfield was amazing he really set the stone for this film his acting I believe is what boosted this movie even more than it already was The story itself is unbelievable because it shows you how FaceBook came about and shows how Mark Zuckerberg was what some people would say an evil genius I personally believe that Mark was just a misunderstood kid who wanted to prove he was better and capable than anyone else in his field of expertise Although I did catch one mistake in the film there was a reference to Snooki from the Jersey Shore The thing is the reference was made during the timeline in the movie which was at least either 2006 or 2007 at the point of the reference 2006 2007 there wasn t even a thought of Jersey Shore because it wasn t created back then If they didn t make the mistake so obvious I would have given the movie a 10 out of 10 star review but I dropped it to a 9 stars out of 10 star review Overall it was a pretty good movie,10
28 October 2010,Great visual style and acting.....but why make it so dirty and immoral!,First off i want to say that the look of this film was very sophisticated it was very stylised in looking fresh and stunning Also Jesse Eisenberg was beyond amazing as Mark Zukerberg He really played the role of a person with a lack of social skills with intelligence very well and he stole the show without him this film would not have worked Justin Timerlake was really good as well his character i am not a fan of but still he acted really well in this film The rest of the acting was good as well Andrew Garfield acted OK in this film not to be praised as much as Jesse but still a good performance But why did he have to be the one who blasphemed throughout the whole movie I think i have stated the positives of the film but what really ruined it for me was the immorality found on this film There were lots of party scenes where lesbian kissing took place provocative dancing drinking of alcohol explicit use of drugs swearing some rude scenes This really tainted the film and you could have done without it It should have had a 15 rating it s a 12A so even a 8 year old could watch all that filth that is a disturbing thought A thing to note is that it felt that the film had no narrative structure this is not necessarily a criticism but it felt that it was hard to see where the film was going to end up Yes there were flashbacks and it was a bout a court case but it felt the film was all on one level It felt like going on a journey with the characters which was interesting the film had great style and acting but it was tainted by the filth in this film,6
2 October 2010,Facebook Rules,As an avid Facebook user I took the liberties in going to see this film I really didn t know what to expect with this one I actually thought since this was directed by David Fincher that it would be some kind of thriller It s not It s more of a history lesson of how Facebook came to be Really it s about the youngest billionaire in the world how he got there and the people he screwed over to get there They want blood Or at least his money So the film takes you through a series of events that starts out with our protagonist Mark Zuckerberg having a conversation with this attractive girl He screws it up with his mouth and the girl doesn t want anything with him anymore So Mark gets mad literally runs home to write a blog about her and creates a forum that has people rating girls in his school which is Harvard At this point it feels like his motivations are over this girl It s like he wants to succeed just to show her up or something He gets a little help from the Moskovitz brothers one played by Joseph Mazzello the little boy in Jurassic Park who want him to create a Harvard Facebook Mark agrees but doesn t include them in this idea and chooses his own people to help him through this endeavor The Moskovitz boys get angry as Mark gets big with the a new website simply called The Facebook The best part of this movie has got to be Justin Timberlake as Napster genius Sean Parker He steals every scene and he s chalk full of great performances In fact most of the performances in this movie is well done with some slick writing to boot I especially love the scene with the Moskovitz brothers in the board room with the Dean The dialogue exchange there is masterful and it felt like a real conversation between people There s a lot of this in this movie and special care is given to every scene This is a pure Oscar contender if I ever saw one The only true flaw that I ve seen might has to be the ending The film just had to wrap itself up and it just wasn t as satisfying as I hoped Almost sort of anti climatic It s not distracting and won t ruin the overall enjoyment of the film If you are a Facebook person you owe it to yourself to see this movie You might feel dumb afterwords like I had Now if you excuse me I have to go invent something,9
19 February 2011,Man in the Net(work),When news that this film would be made was first released the internet was aflutter but mainly with skepticism The names seemed solid enough David Fincher as director Aaron Sorkin as the scribe Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross scoring but understandably everyone asked how would one make a movie about Facebook Who s going to watch that The thing is The Social Network is not about Facebook It s perhaps like saying Raiders of the Lost Ark was about the Ark of the Convenant We all know Raiders of the Lost Ark was about Indiana Jones Marion Ravenwood Belloq Thot but less I digress the genesis the success of this movie is in deciding the route to take The film is based upon the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich Mezrich has had another of his books turned into a film before and that film was the awful 21 That s the thing when I heard of 21 I desperately wanted it to be something like The Social Network turned out to be Spurned by his ex girlfriend Rooney Mara gifted but very unlikable Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg Eisenberg spitefully creates facemash a website to rate the appearance of the campus femmes And so begins his roller coaster journey to becoming Time magazine s 2010 Person of the Year and the youngest billionaire alive His best friend Eduardo Saverin Garfield the affluent and influential twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss Armie Hammer Josh Pence as stand in and freewheeling and charismatic Napster founder Sean Parker all become chess pieces Zuckerberg plays and pieces will fall off the board David Fincher is known for being able to spin engaging yarns that affect on a psychological level and pull audiences along for the ride The Social Network is no different From the get go it s a kinetic mile a minute experience akin to watching a high quality action film only that there s not one explosion in The Social Network With a screenplay like Aaron Sorkin s it doesn t need any at all The Social Network is slick and a complete filmgoing experience it feels like a great amount of effort was put into every aspect of production Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield carry the film ably natch and have immediately become hot commodities in Hollywood the former nominated for a Best Actor Oscar up against the likes of Colin Firth and Jeff Bridges the latter the new Spider Man Indeed Garfield gave off a strong Peter Parker type vibe changing my early opinions about The Amazing Spider Man after seeing that horrid costume Stylistically and aesthetically the film is pretty much perfect glamorous and sexy Jeff Cronenwerth s cinematography is smooth and cool the film fashioning itself as an exclusive inside look behind the scenes giving us hoi polloi a peek at the dangerous and exciting underbelly of the Facebook machine However that s the thing it looks too pretty to feel like it s based on a true story Indeed most of the film does feel like conjecture but it doesn t matter because it tells a good story The Social Network probably didn t set out to be a documentary anyway Jesse Eisenberg s Mark Zuckerberg is actually one of the greatest screen villains of all time in the company of the likes of Anthony Hopkins Hannibal Lecter Heath Ledger s Joker and Malcolm McDowell s Alex When characters who display traits of Asperger s Syndrome feature in movies they re usually very nice deep down or quirky and odd but likable Zuckerberg as portrayed here is anything but ruthless cold incredibly intelligent and with barely a shred of sympathetic quality until the very end of the film The way the film presents it the only true good guy swimming in the sea of sharks is Eduardo Saverin as played by Garfield probably because the real life Saverin was the only member of the Facebook team who served as consultant to author Ben Mezrich Still Garfield is charming real and puts his game face on to tackle the screenplay and wins The supporting cast is strong particularly Justin Timberlake s suave self assured turn as Napster founder Sean Parker However I do question the decision to have Armie Hammer portray both Winklevoss twins his visage digitally pasted onto body double Josh Pence to achieve the effect Sure the CGI looks almost flawless but it does sometimes blasphemous as it sounds remind one of any of the awful Eddie Murphy comedies where he insists on playing both characters Hammer is a decent actor but try as he might he was unable to sell the idea of two separate characters who look and sound alike but are otherwise individuals Aaron Sorkin master of the walk and talk genre as displayed in The West Wing gives us a run and talk instead his screenplay demonstrating incredibly brisk and astute pacing throwing in the right amount of technobabble so we can tenuously believe the computer know how that went into creating the website and also developing compelling complex characters that you just can t look away from Ultimately the film is much like a modern day retelling of Mary Shelly s Frankenstein of how a brilliant misunderstood and possibly evil genius created a monster a monster that escaped his control granting him fame and fortune by way of invading the lives of 600 million people around the world and for so effectively getting such a frightening reality to take strong roots in the minds of such a mass audience The Social Network is exceedingly praiseworthy Jedd Jong,9
23 January 2011,The Internet is forever,Two people are sitting on a park bench her head leans on his shoulder She thinks he s cute and funny after he spent a week flicking her sweet nothings with his thumbs she hides a screen under the counter at her workplace Neither of them have ever given a minute s thought to who invented the cell phone but things are going to work out for them because of it The Social Network is a movie about the inventors and the programmers and the things that make them bother to program and invent Margaret Atwood put interesting words in the mouth of her protagonist in Oryx and Crake The male frog in mating season makes as much noise as it can Small male frogs it s been documented discover if they position themselves in empty drainpipes the pipe acts as a voice amplifier and the small frog appears much larger than it really is So that s what art is for the artist an empty drainpipe An amplifier A stab at getting laid Mark Zuckerberg brilliantly played as a borderline Asperger s case by Jesse Eisenberg is the very incarnation of this energy His art is programming He uses it to get back at the people women he feels have given him short shrift He uses it to gain attention and perhaps secretly hopes to be loved for it His frustrations lead him to build the road that half a billion people travel along on their way to each other For him it may be a dead end The movie gets everything right The screenplay has been exalted in many words I ll only say that if you enjoy hearing intelligent conversation the first scene is all the encouragement you need As a place where people could plausibly have these kinds of conversations in real life Harvard is the perfect setting and justice is finally done to an Ivy League school after years of nerf visions like The Skulls The pacing of the movie is relentless no slow second act and a big exhale after two hours Fincher s direction and cinematography are good because they re never not good with the rowing race scene one of the most memorable and outstanding moments in a career that has included Seven and Fight Club Actors fantastic Score wonderful You really should see this movie,10
17 August 2021,Crappy gift wrapped so nicely,I agree that the director and the script writer do a great job of dramatization Biographical genre is a tricky to have an interesting structure of narrative but Fincher and Sorkin surmount this handicap by choosing a few important events and focusing on them Sorkin trim down the whole success story of Zuckerberg into two hours in organized way He is smart enough to create the outer narrative which is Zukerberg s lawsuit happening in 2008 The history of foundation and development of Facebook is told as inner narrative and he can skip trivial episodes without worrying about leap of logic or gap in chronological order and focus on big and important chunk of events by coming back to present after that each chunk It is strange that The Social Network grasps audience even though most characters are petty unappealing one dimensional and short sighted Their lawsuit and even their achievements look pathetic and stupid because they are originated from their jealousy pretention and inferiority complex However the power of story compensates for weakness Fincher s portrayal of women is problematic From the very beginning a group of women in tight dress are shown In Harvard some make history participate in Olympics or invest create jobs while women in Harvard just party naked Fincher can just omit pointless scenes Overall women are described as tools tools in building Facebook and tools in making this film Zukerberg publicly writes personal attack mentioning her body and comparing her with farm animals and encourages Internet users to compare women Of course the movie can describe his action or behavior so many cruel and inhumane things can occur in the movie However what upsets me is that his criminal activity is dealt so lightly and carelessly Same goes with Sean Parker and his involvement with teenage girls It is just Okay behavior both in story and in film I hate everything the movie tells but it tells well with eloquence so I listened and remained focused the whole time Very strange,7
24 January 2011,"I'm not just coming back for 30%, I'm coming back for everything.",OK so I went into this movie thinking it was going to be some boring and self serving expose on some super nerd s rise to top of the tech bubble I thought for sure this film would either demonize him or them or everyone Instead what we got looked like a pretty decent and realistic account of how this deal went down No one was demonized well except for maybe Sean Parker of Napster infamy Every side was represented fairly via their own perceptions The dialogue was fast paced sometimes hard to follow Zuckerberg was played flawlessly with lightspeed razor sharp quips that left recipients in shock and awe I went in thinking I would be bored out of my mind I left completely satisfied that I had ridden that crazy train of Facebook to the top And what a fun and bumpy ride it was Two thumbs up,8
27 January 2011,So what?,I truly do not understand why people like this film Yes the actors look good So what Yes the performances are credible So what Were the characters worth learning about No They were all jerks who I would just as soon have seen pummeled to death Was there a story here worth watching No Did the movie illuminate something important about the human condition Not a chance Yes the internet is important including Facebook But that doesn t mean that it s at all interesting or important for us to see how it was done The film is technically proficient which is why I gave it a 4 but it isn t good story telling There s no story here worth the telling,4
24 November 2020,Preparation for Mank: The Social Network is the outstanding result of joining two brilliant minds like David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin.,If you enjoy reading my Spoiler Free reviews please follow my blog Here we go with the fourth review of a David Fincher s film this week in preparation for the upcoming Mank directed by the same person who delivered phenomenal movies like Se7en Fight Club Zodiac and more Now it s time for The Social Network which premise can be summed up in the story behind the creation of Facebook Ten years have passed since its release and the real Mark Zuckerberg already stated that most of the film is based on fictional events and conversations Truth is this movie was never marketed as a true story but yes as an adaptation of Ben Mezrich s 2009 book The Accidental Billionaires It s a film like any other not a detailed account of whatever happened in real life With that said this is easily one of the best adapted screenplays of all time Aaron Sorkin the man behind one of the best movies of 2020 The Trial of the Chicago 7 demonstrates his incredibly talented writing skills in The Social Network proving that he s one of the most meticulous writers working today If you ve been reading my previous reviews there s a couple of compliments I keep giving to Fincher which are his extreme attention to detail and his impressive dedication to the narrative he wants to tell So what happens when you put together two of the most perfectionist filmmakers ever An award worthy best of the year contender arises from their gifted minds There s not even much to discuss besides the narrative itself since this is by far the aspect that elevates the whole film Jeff Cronenweth who previously worked in Fight Club brings out Fincher s trademark realistic look and feel through his simple yet powerful cinematography Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross original score is packed with little effects that resemble computer sounds making it quite addictive while also increasing the movie s energy in the most exciting sequences Finally just like in Zodiac the editing work Angus Wall Kirk Baxter is absolutely seamless and it s definitely the technical component that better helps Sorkin s screenplay shine due to the latter s structure Throughout the entire runtime the story is told through a nonlinear timeline mixing up Facebook s actual creation ideas planning programming with the future legal issues that Mark Zuckerberg faces This structure allows for an exceptionally captivating and tremendously entertaining couple of hours by never letting the pacing slow down or to have an uneventful sequence The protagonist is accused of stealing the concept from the Winklevoss twins both interpreted by Armie Hammer gets in trouble with his best friend Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield over the website s monetization and Sean Parker Justin Timberlake is partially the trigger for a lot of the chaos that ends up overwhelming Zuckerberg s life Sorkin and Fincher s greatest accomplishment is their success in making the viewer feel invested in a main character who s an utter asshole an adjective with a lot of weight in the film Jesse Eisenberg is remarkable as one of those characters people love to hate no wonder the real Zuckerberg didn t enjoy the movie since he s depicted as a contemptible friend Eisenberg has a unique manner of speaking and distinctive mannerisms that are perfect for this character Garfield and Timberlake are also formidable incorporating their characters effortlessly Once again comparing with Zodiac The Social Network is also a dialogue driven narrative but the latter resonated with me a bit more due to my area of work The only issue I have involves the Winklevoss family Armie Hammer is excellent as both twins as is Max Minghella as Divya Narendra but their subplot occasionally drifts from the main story losing my interest for those short moments There s even a rowboat race that feels out of place and unnecessary but I admit that it s gorgeously shot and accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack Despite this little misstep Fincher continues to impress me with his outstanding directing techniques forcing the actors to prove their worth by making them go through their dialogues faster and implementing long takes every time that s possible All in all The Social Network is yet another masterful piece of cinema this time delivered by not one but two magnificent filmmakers David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin employ their mutual perfectionism and meticulousness to create an extraordinarily engaging narrative Boasting a nonlinear but tremendously effective structure the two pillars of any film story and characters are wonderfully built even reaching the point of making the viewer feel invested in a despicable yet fascinating protagonist Jesse Eisenberg shines in a career defining performance but Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake also rise to the necessary level of dedication dealing with the rapid fire dialogues and outstanding long takes seamlessly Technically great camera work offers a realistic feel an addictive score increases the excitement levels and flawless editing makes the different timelines shift seamlessly Despite an occasionally unnecessary irrelevant detour concerning a minor subplot this is another brilliant addition to Fincher s filmography Rating A,9
25 October 2011,Compelling to a point but runs out of steam after a while,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,
25 October 2010,Dishonest to the last frame.,This film is so desperate to sex up the life of a code nerd with Asperger syndrome and ram home its banal theme the man who created Facebook has no friends that the truth complexity and to my mind fascinating aspects of the real story gets thrown under the onrushing bus of one dimensional fiction It s a hit job on a pack of real human beings and their motivations Tonally thematically and factually dishonest to the last frame Good music though and Eisenberg deserves the praise he s getting The very source of this film is suspect The book it s taken from was solely the revenge creation of Eduardo Saverin who approached the author after Saverin felt he had been jilted by Zuckerberg The book was a revenge hit that left out facts defamed people and made no attempt to interview any other parties involved in the matter It was considered a joke and was never taken seriously by either the tech crowd or the press Now the movie hits and has Saverin being the good guy and Sean Parker who actually helped Facebook grow into what it is today and is still a behind the scenes consultant not to mention one of the most influential coders of our time as the bad guy I don t think Sorkin or Fincher have any clue about the code monkeys who have changed their world forever and if they do they certainly don t seem to care enough to make real complicated ambitious art about them,6
30 May 2021,sure,Sure its well made but this wan t really that impressive to me The story had a nice flow to it but the story itself wasn t really that well made Especially the ending gawdy So yea well made but has very little substance 6 10 theres better out there,6
30 July 2021,A great movie,This is one of those movies that you don t look at your watch to see when it will end Very engaging,9
28 July 2020,Incredible Film with amazing acting and many themes.,When I first saw this movie in my feed searching for what to watch I saw it was about Facebook laughed a bit and added it to my watch later because I had heard it was considered classic but I was skeptical Plus it featured Jesse an actor that while I don t know many actors in general is one I respect a lot I finally get around to watching the movie and I am floored Nearly every scene you can tell the mood what every character is feeling Mark in this movie is an incredibly deep character and the other supporting roles while not the most developed don t need to be as seeing how Jesse interacts with different roles and stereotypes is fascinating You could watch this movie through the lens of Mark being the villain or a man just trying to stand out I cannot overstate how impressed I am with how all of the themes and conflicts entangle themselves in this film A great work to be sure,9
11 March 2011,Inspired and Marvelous,The Social Network is my pick for the best movie of 2010 On the surface it may seem to be just a movie about Facebook but it is much more than that Its script weaves together eloquent conversations about friendship betrayal jealousy and intelligence Jesse Eisenberg masterfully portrays Mark Zuckerberg a gifted student at Harvard with a brilliant idea Little does he know that his brilliant idea will throw him into two lawsuits which ask for a great deal of money The film moves back and forth through a timeline of a few years with events ranging from the later involvement of Sean Parker to a fantastic canoeing race The directing from David Fincher is remarkable with each scene of speedy expertly crafted dialogue seeming like cinematic heaven The performances of Eisenberg Garfield and Timberlake are gripping and awards worthy The Social Network with its phenomenal script breathtaking direction and demanding performances help make it the Best Picture worthy film that it is,10
2 October 2010,The Year's Best,Aaron Sorkin called this film a court room drama so I will too The Social Network is directed by David Fincher and stars Jesse Eisenberg Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake The film takes place at Harvard in 2003 The film begins with 19 year old Mark Zuckerberg Eisenberg on a date with a Boston University student Erica Albright At the date Erica breaks up with Mark because of how rude he is Mark tries to get her back but is unable to Then Mark gets drunk and starts blogging about how much he dislikes his girlfriend while at the same time with his roommates creating a website known as facesmash where students at Harvard choose which one of their female peers are more attractive The site crashes the Harvard network because it got 22 000 hits extremely quickly at four in the morning The film then goes on to show how the Winklevoss twins hire Mark to create a social networking site The film cuts back and forth to the future where Mark Zuckerberg is simultaneously being sued by his best friend Eduardo Garfield and the Winklevoss twins The screenplay for this film was absolutely brilliant Like many people when I heard that there was going to be a movie about the founders of Facebook I was not too excited but this film really is not about the founders It is about the relationships they have with each other and the dark deeds they did to get Facebook going The writing is very fast paced as well just like the world of Facebook Sorkin fills the script with brilliant wit and is able to keep a bunch of kids in a house interesting for a surprisingly long time The characters are extremely well developed and I support them all yet I see their faults The end of this film is absolutely brilliantly as well one of the best conclusions I have seen in years If Aaron Sorkin does not win an Oscar for his screenplay then I do not know what the world is coming to The direction for this film by the Oscar nominated David Fincher was stunning as well First of all the rowing scene That scene was some of the best cinematography I have ever seen and I remember turning to my friend and saying to him that I bet this film wins for the best cinematography at the Oscars and he said that he would not take that bet even though he would get every other film that came out this year Now personally I would have taken that bet because the odds are fantastic Fincher got great performances from all of the actors and I really liked seeing how he evolved from really a director of cult hits like Fight Club to something so beautiful as this that everyone can enjoy Like Sorkin I believe he deserves an Oscar for this film as well but I do not think it is as high of a chance as Sorkin winning one I was surprised at how good the acting was in this film Usually when I think Jesse Eisenberg I think about Michael Cera because they always play the same sort of awkward roles But The Social Network is to Eisenberg is like what Boogie Nights was to Wahlberg It shows the world that not only can Eisenberg act he can act really well His magnificent portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg may even earn him an Oscar nomination The way he moved and his facial expressions and even that blank stare on his face was just magnificent This is the first time I have seen Andrew Garfield act and I thought he did a fine job as well as Mark s best friend and the CFO of Facebook Eduardo Saverin Not Oscar nomination worthy but he made me care about his character that was being left behind the rest of the Facebook founders Justin Timberlake played the part of Sean Parker and had some great comedic moments in the film I have always respected Timberlake as an actor ever since I saw him in Alpha Dog and in this film I thought he was perfect The rest of the cast was also great throughout the film The score for this film I liked a lot as well It was basically almost all sort of electronic sounds for the most part which really worked with the internet theme of the film The only part that I remember where it did not sound electronically was the rowing scene I mentioned in the paragraph about the direction was that very famous classical piece that I do not know the name of The score was perfect for this film Overall I give this film a 10 10 There was absolutely no way it could be improved in my personal opinion and I believe it is a perfect film I would not be surprised if this film wins Best Picture at the Oscars I know I would support it to In my review of The Town I stated that it was the best film of the year that I have seen so far Well The Social Network blows it out of the water Everyone must see this stop reading and head to the theatre,10
23 September 2011,A document of our times,The subject matter really isn t as interesting as the film makes it out to be the story of Facebook is a pretty standard one in the world of internet entrepreneurship and in the long run I suspect will not be more than a historical footnote which is of course the risk you take when making a movie about current or recent events The film itself though is masterfully done extremely fast paced without ever losing the audience s attention and skillfully avoids dozens of very expected clich s making it to all purposes the first solid mainstream work from David Fincher We may have lost Fincher the angsty bad boy forever but we may have a new Spielberg on our hands,8
12 January 2011,One of the best films of 2010.,The Social Network has achieved the almost impossible a movie about the creation of a website should be boring but they not only made it interesting they ve made it thrilling This purportedly true story about Facebook is primarily a legal drama mostly focusing on the dispute between Mark Zuckerberg and the other Harvard University students who claimed to have also been contributory in the social networking website s creation After burning a few more bridges and pissing off his few remaining friends Zuckerberg finds himself in a litigation nightmare A script written by Aaron Sorkin who has created some blisteringly sharp dialogue that will leave you hanging on every word spoken by the outstanding cast Eisenberg is outstanding and presents the Facebook founder as a socially stunted savant unable to relate to other people as anything other than a means to some other end his misogynistic attitudes towards women a particular flaw The Social Network has a definite revenge of the nerds feel about it with its oafish jocks exaltation of hackers and nerd groupies The film is also an interesting product of the hyper fast social world it has helped to create a biopic about someone still alive and in his mid 20s and relating events that only happened a couple of years ago Just how much of the story is really true is anyone s guess but it is certainly thought provoking and the brilliant script and Eisenberg s performance make it worth seeing in any case One of the best films of 2010,9
12 January 2023,Why didn't Andrew Garfield win an Acadamy Award for best supportning role?,I do belive that this movie has a very well written script great locations and good actors I like the way that Mark and Eduardos relationship was portrayted the way that Mark is the inventor and coder But because of his loss of social charisma thought the actor Jesse Eisenberg has huge charisma on the big screen and money he needs Eduardo who is on the opposite to Mark socialy talanted I wonder if he would ve involved Eduardo if he d possessed these traits as a companion unrelying on him for money or width of the company I really dislike the character Sean Parker since he ruins the relationship between Eduardo and Mark I belive it s one of the best biopic movie in the last few years because of the accuracy to the real story,8
12 February 2019,He's More Fred C. Dobbs or Charlie Kane than Daniel LaRusso!,Absolutely brilliant and very hard to define Is it a drama A satire A coming of age story I went to Columbia University in the Reagan Eighties and I hated every minute of it This movie captures the environment perfectly spoiled rich kids binge drinking callous administrators self impressed instructors hatefulness and evil triumphing over ideals and hope Man I hated Columbia And I loved this movie for explaining why Yet at the same time I hated this movie because it s so craven and so desperate to uphold the status quo In terms of tone it s really not so much a modern KARATE KID as it is a mash up of CITIZEN KANE and TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE Except that John Huston treats his bums with a lot more compassion than this movie treats its heroes,7
16 June 2020,Where did the $25 billion go?,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,6

22 December 2010,"Shadows are falling, and he's been there all day.",THE SOCIAL NETWORK the new film about Mark Zuckenberg and his co founders of Facebook has amounted great reviews and been hailed by many as the film of 2010 and even I as a skeptic from the start have to say that it is a brilliant movie This not only out of its mastery of film craft such as use of music editing cinematography acting story and dialog but also because of its timing It s released at a time when everybody everywhere knows exactly what it s about people watching the film are those in reality involved in the film s plot The screenplay written by Aaron Sorkin is great and this albeit it revolves around a story that would be fairly difficult if it hadn t been so entertainingly and intelligently written As a viewer one watches a computer programmer work out his mind to become the number one internet phenomena of this century and as fore mentioned writer Sorkin moves fast and one has to stay focused throughout to get the entire momentum The film feels cold cynical and detached much like Zuckenberg acts greatly by Jesse Eisenberg but it s singularly about something that gathers interests and matters Facebook So there is naturally something very emotional and very human about the entire personification of numbers codes and data as it has our name picture and bio in it The irony of the story is bleak and sad it opens with Zuckerberg seated in a crowded university bar chatting intensely to say the least with a girl and ends with him alone almost blankly introspective tapping nocturnally on the page he created it s the man who owns the world but sold his soul,9
6 June 2021,"Gets Better With Time, This One",Odd I watched this movie a couple of times back when it first came out and loved it Sorkin Fincher and such a good cast it s all very very good But this was an early first take at history How does it stand up now I ve just watched it with my girls two of them teens and early on they couldn t get their heads around the fact that there was the web but no social network How did that have to be invented That s always the implicit take of this movie Showing you how this thing which we have now everywhere started It s a startling story No one Not least the people involved grasped how big it would be I m pleased to say it absolutely stands up today Long after the valuation of FaceBook looks ridiculous at the end of the movie Like Withnail it concentrates on how life moves on and the loss of a dear and only friend The writing directing and cast are terrific,9
27 July 2011,great movie!,This movie is brought to by the same man who brought us fight club so could you expect anything less then a great movie This is a true story so it makes it all the more exciting with a great script and captivating characters This is the true story of the invention of facebook Mark Zuckerberg Eisenberg invents facebook then is sued by a couple people that say he stole their idea It has a very simple story line that most people probably already know because of its relevance in society This movie is great It has good scenes great acting and very good directing It has funny moments and drama as well If you like a good drama based on a true story this is for you If you have something against facebook or social networking this probably is not for you,
16 November 2010,"of life, love, loss, friendship, betrayal, greed and power",A nerdy Harvard student and his geeky mates play a misogynistic prank on their female peers and end up creating a multi billion dollar company known today as Facebook From such everyday fare Fincher conjures up a tight keenly observed movie encompassing Shakespearean levels of farce and tragedy Biopics are not history and anyone wishing to know the true tale of friendships made and lost as vast fortunes arose from nothing is advised to go the the library Sorkin s predictably verbose script from the kick off unashamedly declares itself authentically Sorkin rather than authentically undergrad class of 2003 As a movie Social Network details the egos and neuroses that unthread interpersonal relationships on the Harvard campus as young men find themselves ill prepared to navigate the juggernaut they create Jesse Eisenberg plays Mark Zuckerberg as charmless and dislikeable but utterly compelling His triumph is that you come away from the film pitying a character worth 26 billion dollars Andrew Garfield proves more grounded and yet gullible as Eduardo Saverin the partner who took a huge settlement to walk away Very quickly accelerating to post success Facebook and courtroom drama the film plays mostly in flashback and tests us to figure out at what point exactly Zuckerberg sold his soul to the devil and just who the devil is Sean Parker Lawyers The saps who spend their lives on Facebook making it as huge as it is Fincher s trademark silver and dark blue palette is used to great effect on the rain soaked campus as Harvard s asinine snobby campus culture serves to pervert the minds of young men towards pettiness elitism and a contempt for women When twin brothers suing Zuckerberg use their family connections to meet the President the rot is shown to emanate from the core as he brutishly fails to see the nature of the problem before him This is a highly enjoyable timeless tale of greed myopia and the corrupting influence of power slickly executed by one of the most accomplished filmmakers around,8

7 April 2020,Way better than it needed to be.,I can only imagine how difficult it must have been to make a movie about the founding of Facebook difficult Part of that is obviously due to the dramatization and the bending of the truth but credit is more than due to David Fincher s directing Aaron Sorkin s screenplay and the performances given by Jesse Eisenberg Andrew Garfield Justin Timberlake and just about everyone else There s a line in Honest Trailers that claims that the movie is so good it makes young millionaires suing each other high stakes As for the aforementioned bending of the truth well the movie does it pretty often Mark Zuckerberg didn t come up with the idea after breaking up with his girlfriend he wasn t really obsessed with exclusive Harvard clubs and Sean Parker wasn t a coked out paranoiac Do watch the film unless you want to know the real story of Facebook,9

1 February 2012,"""..You pretentious d*uche bag!""",B Despite avoiding the direct title this film will forever be known as the Facebook movie In the same fashion as Oliver Stone s Wall Street this film s focus is on the greed for money and thirst for power that drives people I hear people constantly go on about how the film was shot and yes I acknowledge that it does look rather fantastic with a fine polished look to the images And the performances do surprise you I m not familiar with Andrew Garfield but he did quite well Brenda Song of Disney channel stars who I thought would anger me actually serves up a nice performance Armie Hammer I must definitely give kudos to and Timberlake another popular pop icon does very nicely And then we come to Jesse Eisenburg the perpetual Gordon Gekko of the movie Now the problem is I don t care what any critic says Eisenburg literally kept the same facial expression during the ENTIRE movie His talent lay in several smart aleck quips he delivers thru out the run time culminating in his eventual hollow victory At least it s portrayed as hollow seeing as he sits there refreshing a Facebook page belonging to a girl he humiliated Speaking of which because I assume the character was an ex I had no idea today s college students with all our texting e mails and whatnot actually passed notes in classrooms but I digress The tactic is clear to tell a story about the abandoned morality of the business man fueled by a contemporary techno like score I didn t care much for leaving us with a climax where a substantial profit is made some profit more than others and man ya character feel cheated and no one appears truly happy IT s charming to look at but like Eisenburg s character it feels hollow Director Fincher definitely knows how to tell a story and how to say mouthfuls about his characters some of them but the story everyone praise seems off to me I m not a guy who roots for the hero after all I find Michael Douglass portrayal of Wall Street tycoon Gordon Gekko to be one of my favorite roles of all time I deeply enjoyed the character but the ones here I repeat just come off as hollow,7
15 January 2011,A Fincher classic,The social Network directed by David Fincher is the story behind the pillar of our social lives Facebook It claims to dramatize the events that took place in developing facebook Mark Zukerberg Eisenberg just after being dumped by his girlfriend and drunk defames her on his blog he later creates facemash com a portal to rate and compare university girls based on their looks All this leads to a lot of flak from others and then an idea The idea that will become the most used social networking platform ever But this idea is built on with the help of the winklevoss twins Hammer and funded by his best friend Eduardo Garfield But a few years later we see Zukerberg at a court being sued by the Winklevoss brothers and Eduardo The film is about the events that led to the case We all know this the real Zukerberg claimed the film is almost entirely fiction while the makers claimed its entirely true and only dramatized This very difference of opinion made millions to want to watch this movie But all that apart the social network is another Fincher classic Fabulous performance from Eisenberg and Garfield also Timberlake was surprisingly convincing as the cunning and suave entrepreneur Sean parker The perfect casting is the highlight of this movie and a great screenplay by Aron Sorkin complements it The dialogues are smart yet they don t seem dramatic the pace of the film never makes any moment of this two hour flick seem boring And so it really doesn t matter if its fiction or completely real the events in the social network is something you will remember often when you add a friend or like a comment on facebook simply because a 25 billion dollar company that puts wheels our social lives couldn t have been made for the silver screen in a better and classy way,8
22 November 2021,Captivating,There is so much going on in this movie genius selfishness loyalty betrayal greed and brilliance The movie is constructed with such tension that at times it feels almost like a thriller The score really adds to that feeling So fascinating,10
2 February 2011,Definitely an over-rated movie,My guess is 99 of the people who think that this movie is awesome have facebook or at least no about it My point is if somebody with no knowledge whatsoever of Facebook went to see The Social Network he or she would just have found it dead boring Though I do know about Facebook I found it dead boring I don t understand how it could have win the Golden Globes Best movie It s basically a pseudo biographical movie pseudo because it isn t even 80 accurate 100 being impossible The acting was decent but the storyline didn t have anything special in it except of course if you are one of those Facebook addict and find it interesting to understand where did this phenomenon came from Cinematrographically this movie deserve a 1 10 David Fincher definitely didn t show any of his filming talent in this one What a shame Take my advice don t go see The Social Network unless you want to spend 2hours seeing Harvard guys talking about Final Clubs,4
22 September 2011,Flavour of the Year?,I remember 17 years ago I m guessing buying a film magazine presumably Empire here in the UK that had an article entitled The 100 Greatest Films of All Time or some such Somewhere in the list was Interview With The Vampire and I remember thinking that it was only in the list because it was new and that if a similar list was drawn up at any year in the future then the film wouldn t appear Sure enough I ve never seen it on such a list since fine film though it is It s very good but one of the best 100 ever I don t think so Which brings me to TSN It s a good film possible a very good one but one worthy of IMDb s Top 250 I don t think so It s an interesting story with some interesting characters that tell the story of one of the major social developments of our time but it certainly isn t a Great film Much of the acting is of a high standard the direction is strong and the film certainly looks nice thanks to some inspired cinematography but I just didn t think it was as good as the IMDb rating led me to expect I saw it last night within a week of watching The Secret In Their Eyes To me unless you have a pathological hatred of subtitled movies there s no question at all as to which is the better film One is good going on very good the other is magnificent Yet their scores on here are almost identical But we re all different If you haven t seen TSN I d recommend that you do so as it s a nice way to spend a couple of hours If you go to see it expecting to have to re write your own personal list of Greatest Films Of All Time then you might not need to do so after watching it I d be interested to see if the film s score drops over the years My bet is that it will,8
7 September 2020,Boring movie,I mean for me the movie it is really boring but it is good to know how facebook was created I didn t know the kind of person that is Mark Zuckerberg i don t like him at all after the movie,4
29 August 2011,Riveting Fincher/Sorkin collaboration,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,
11 November 2015,Slow-Paced but Still a Good Movie,I went into this movie with pretty high hopes Considering I d just watched a handful of great movies with lower user scores and higher metascores and I thought I d love this one just as much as those It was a lot slower than I expected but it may have felt that way due to the fact that I started watching it at midnight The Social Network is a pretty interesting movie It follow the guy Mark Zuckerberg who created facebook and all the problems that occur during and after this process It s well made and the plot is interesting As someone who uses facebook a fair amount it was interesting to see who made it I know it wasn t Jesse Eisenberg don t worry and how it was made The characters were the primary driving force in the movie it seemed Jesse Eisenberg as usual played a great nerdy character who doesn t seem to understand human emotion that well It s a typical role for him but he does it extremely well As for everyone else they were all interesting characters who change throughout the movie making it feel a lot more realistic Although it is a biography so of course it s expected to be realistic Overall The Social Network is a solid movie With great acting and interesting characters and plot it s worth a watch It wasn t as great as some of the previous movies I ve watched lately and it was definitely a slower paced movie but it s still good If your interested give it a watch It s worthwhile If you didn t enjoy it then that s okay I can see why In the end I probably would recommend it but maybe only to people whom I think would like it,8
18 June 2020,"Is it not one the coolest thing ever, I mean the social media?",What worked Screenplay and narrative the story is so fresh engaging stylish clever and interesting The movie takes us on a ride at the starting days of Zuckerberg s Facebook It s hard not to like the casts and characters The background scores and editing added the flavor The movie is deep and meaningful too and I loved the ending of the movie What did not work I would have wanted more depth in the character of Mark maybe his background his struggles not only his brilliance and also some contemplation Final verdict Recommended it s an powerful ride,8
19 October 2010,A well made film that draws out what it can from a rather limited topic.,It s hard to make a film about Facebook sound interesting How do you jazz up the most banal of topics It would be like trying to sell a storyline gravitated on the walk to the shops How many people would spend their hard earned dough watching someone buying a pint of milk and a few hundred grams of Crunchy Nut Any takers No Well you re just going to have to go with it Stick with me please as I give you the lowdown on the hottest bit of reel this side of Inception This recent release didn t get 8 stars for nothing you know The Social Network is a film about Facebook yet there is barely a poke like or wall post in sight This is not as one may imagine at first glance a rom com played out through the interweb The focus of David Fincher s latest flick is the stuff behind the scenes the stuff many of us have little idea about and have even less interest in The plot is simple Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg is a Harvard Computer Science geek desperate to join the frat scene He invents Facebook although others are keen to make claim to their stakes We thus see the rise of the company through a retrospective retelling of events as scrutinised in a rather awkward pre court hearing The narrative naturally gravitates the viewers attention to focus on the Zuckerberg s blunt autisms We feel his pain his frustrations and his vision though because of the man he is we remain distant This is a guy that pays more attention to the architecture of a nightclub than the music it plays Yet there is an honesty about his straightforward manner that appeals that amuses Just as this is no triumphant celebration of the youngest billionaire in the States neither is it a scathing critique of those that launched successful assaults to rob him of his dollars The Winklevoss twins played by two people but both featuring Armie Hammer s head are what we would call preppy They are snobs who readily use Daddy s contacts to yield the desirable results But we don t hate them for it No they seem like nice enough chaps Instead the viewer is drawn to giggle at this double act s forthcoming whit Think Price William meets the Chuckle Brothers The best thing about the Winklevoss pair has to be the perplexing technical mastery at work that enables the one actor s head to be digitally sewn on to another actor s body to give the illusion of identical twins that are always stood side by side The biggest surprise undoubtedly has to be the coherent acting of Justin Timberlake In the role of Sean Parker the bankrupt Napster founder who flirts with drugs and underage girls Timberlake adds a bit of spice to the mix Parker pushes both Facebook and the narrative to more exciting places Whilst his revolutionary spirit is most prominent we are occasionally reminded of the geek behind the flashy fa ade Ultimately though we just like Zuckerberg admire the man that pioneered the rise of music sharing software and the subsequent decline of the music industry This is the story of youth fighting back The Social Network is also a story of the geek fighting back and in order to connect the audience with the social outcast a series of subplots are set up One of these is a rather dire love story This underdeveloped series of exchanges is placed on the periphery of the narrative It seems as though they have been tagged on to the first an last minutes of the film in order to round off a rather open ending and give the impression of a slightly more traditional narrative structure All that it does though is give a rather soppy nice finish to an otherwise different sort of film A fairly uneventful 120 minutes puts The Social Network more in line with Fincher s prior release The Curious Case of Benjamin Button than his earlier thrillers Fight Club and Seven Although a grand climax is neither built nor delivered there is not a minute of stagnation The two hours rapidly disappear as the audience remains hooked by the tightest of scripts whilst an abundance of commendable performances bring a turbulent blend of conflict passion and humour to the screen The Social Network is a well made film that draws out what it can from a rather limited topic,8
24 November 2010,"Not quite the movie of the year, but...",This is the true story film of the year The big problem with it is that the story is so good it would be brilliant in any narrative medium Personally the most cinematic elements of the film were the rowing race and the inter cutting of the court cases The former being superfluous to the film in many ways The rest of the movie only works great as a movie because of the acting which is top class Other than that I d happily read the story in a book or see it as a play probably the medium where it would seem it s most profound There are standout scenes but nothing struck me as anything exclusive to film This is why I rate it a seven The story and acting make the movie worth the watch,7
30 April 2018,"Very well characterized and directed movie, well-rounded and enjoyable",The Social Network is a classic clean well cut directed and written movie that is easy to watch and makes you think Eisenberg is wonderful in the role of Zuckerberg and paints a realistic and ambiguous picture of a complex man with a big modern influence I always find true story movies like this to be wild and extremely valuable to watch Nothing in the story blows you away and the ending is lifelike obviously as it s based on what really happened in that it wasn t overly dramatic and not all characters had clean deserved endings A very satisfying well rounded film,8
30 May 2021,"""We lived on farms, then we lived in cities, and now we're going to live on the internet!""",I don t know how Fincher does it but I always love the movies no matter what they re about Zuckerberg is an arrogant dude no doubt What is intriguing is how this person came to be one of the most influential and powerful behind the scenes entrepreneur of the world Social media will be our downfall,10
13 August 2011,Meh,The film is beautifully shot and directed with the shots perfectly placed The rowing sequence is gorgeous and deserves some recognition The acting is also quite good Jesse does a brilliant job of being a hard to love genius but idiotic at the same time as his business skills are awful However the dialogue is rushed and badly written The opening scene is extremely confusing and could be an instant turn off The story is also very drawn out and the back and forth swap from the original story and the later on questioning Brenda Song is probably the most annoying actress to have either walked the earth and every scene with her in was insanely cringe worthy and almost made me laugh it was so awful All in all a quite tedious drawn out annoying film with a brilliant director of photography,7
10 November 2010,Idiot savant,Took a chance seeing this movie as a film about the founder of Facebook didn t really sound that interesting It s gotten good reviews though so I took a punt watching it A good thing too as this is a great movie Many times I found it laugh out loud funny Some of the reviews that I had come across mentioned Justin Timberlake Not into the top 40 music scene so I was wondering about which person he played and made a wrong provisional guess in the process Timberlake does make a great entrance though What s it about It s the story of Mark Zuckerberg played by Jesse Eisenberg a talented university student who studies computers I T If you don t know the name like me you d know of his most famous creation the social network website Facebook It s this website which provides the drama for the movie Who really claims ownership of it or the idea for it We get to see the contenders via flashbacks prompted by legal arguments between Zuckerberg s lawyers and those attempting to sue him for recognition for their contribution to the site concept namely the Winklevi and one time friend Eduardo Saverin played by Andrew Garfield What s to like about the movie Even if the movie was intended be a demolition job on Zuckerberg which I doubt I like the way that you see enough of the context of events to even have sympathy for him or at least see where he was coming from when he does the things he does Jesse Eisenberg gives a sterling performance as Zuckerberg Only after seeing this movie did I see Eisenberg for real in the final episode of The virtual revolution namely Homo interneticus good docu series on the web it s history and impact Not sure that Eisenberg gives a mimicking performance but that s not the point if you want reality you d read a scholarly article right In any case I suppose Eisenberg would be a worthy winner of an Academy Award for Best Actor To my Idiot savant remark in the header that s how Zuckerberg comes across to me No doubt he is very knowledgeable and highly intelligent but sheesh his Emotional IQ is at idiot level One illustration of that is in the opening sequence of the movie where he is on a date with a student he likes Erica Albright played by Rooney Mara In a way this scene is the entire movie writ small it s what the entire movie life is all about it s contended synedoche thanks to a movie by that name which I haven t seen I now know about this word There s a cute scene to end the movie probably artistic licence taken there but it bookends nicely with the opening scene Another example of Zuckerberg s idiocy there s a perplexing scene where Zuckerberg does what Sean Parker played by Justin Timberlake tells him to do Zuckerberg would have an IQ twice that of two people of average intelligence presumably but you can t help but think What the hell where you thinking Not sure if that even was based on fact but if it was it paints Zuckerberg as someone who might just have jumped off a garage roof with a towel around his neck pretending to be Superman It s that idiotic Zuckerberg as a genius man child One thing about Eisenberg s portrayal is that he kind of struck me as a Hannibal Lecter type figure I mean it wouldn t have surprised me if Zuckerberg was in fact a psychopath about to embark on a rampage I d modify my initial impression of him now to idiot savant psycohpath man child Here s the savant part Eisenberg s Zuckerberg is like a robot he seems to pull out zingers out of nowhere like he s computed the optimal bon mot for any given circumstance These are laugh out loud funny at times in a Humans are the funniest animals kind of way Here s the weird thing he comes out with this kind of stuff but it seems like he doesn t get his own jokes I don t know of anyone at all like that Apart from Steven Wright But he really is a robot Who writes jokes for calendars Back to Zuckerberg he s metaphorically lobbing hand grenades left right and centre oblivious to the havoc he is causing because his mind his multi tasking and his attention is always on something more important to him Finally as far as the resolution goes interesting Since I m not trained as a lawyer and you don t really hear this stuff in a legal manner I have to admit a degree of surprise with the outcome as far as the Winklevi are concerned that amusing term is used by Zuckerberg in the movie Even though the genius that is attibuted to Zuckerberg in the movie seems to rest on him knowing abstract geeky stuff to me it seemed to rest on just thinking bigger than those around him But the rationale for the outcome is suggested by the female lawyer at the end The outcome for Eduardo Saverin is undisclosed like in reality I sort of get why Zuckerberg may have done what he did as in striking a bad deal with him perhaps A more lawyerly account might have made me disregard that I certainly hope that he surpassed the Winklevi I m not sure that they really deserved anything As a morality tale this has some subtle shades of grey in it which is what makes it a superior movie I would have liked to have been on a jury to hear this case but it neve got that far and I m Australian so would have had to change my nationality to do so Anyway If you like this movie I also recommend The pirates of Silicon Valley It s another fact based drama on I T legends Saw it on TV some years ago Bill Gates is covered I found myself to have more sympathy for Zuckerberg than Gates who doesn t seem to have the same aspersions cast on him in reality as Zuckerberg does in this movie A pity,10

2 October 2010,Austin Layne likes this,A million dollars isn t cool You know what s cool A billion dollars Sean Parker s statement sets a mood for the battleground that is the Social Network A film that depicts the bitter battle between the simultaneously brilliant and conceded Mark Zuckerberg and practically everyone else who was involved with the invention of Facebook But not only does the statement give a summation of the movie s core it gives a summation of capitalist U S culture as does the rest of the movie Think about it as you watch the alcohol swilling Harvard rich kids are eerily familiar to the Wall Street royalty who really rule this country Is the destruction of Mark Zuckeberg s relationship with his best friend do to a business venture and greediness meant to parallel the collapse of the economy due to the continuous push of businessman for more money I think so But that is another essay Let us now speak of the other fantastic aspects of this film Jesse Eisenberg and Justin Timberlake without a doubt give the best performances of the movie I would like to shed special light on Jesse Eisenberg who plays a character that is much more than the nice guy geek he usually portrays Here he plays a man who is drenched in his own configuration of loneliness alienation despair and pessimism a man who suffers from an over inflated ego who despite being brilliant cannot advance past the point of a computer screen The character of Mark Zuckerberg is much darker than the role Jesse Eisenberg took on in The Squid and the Whale who was almost as irredeemable but eventually proves to be likable The Mark Zuckerberg within The Social Network is entirely irredeemable unlikable but Jesse Eisenberg s amazing talent saves him from being unwatchable and he can at times even be charming Justin Timberlake gives perhaps the best performance of his acting career playing Sean Parker co founder of Napster who sleazily snuck onto the Facebook bandwagon in every scene whispering things into the ear of Mark Zuckerberg almost in an allusion to the Serpent of Genesis causing the change in Adam and Eve that caused their fall from grace This all could ve been overly obvious but the charm Justin Timberlake infuses the character with makes it very subtle and much more ambiguous as to whether it s even there or not All in all I believe The Social Network to be the satire of the decade a title I previously rewarded to There Will Be Blood The only difference for me is that at time There Will Be Blood can be unwatchable or hard to watch for some people and seem like five hours instead of two and a half The Social Network is infinitely watchable and entertaining something that There Will Be Blood just isn t,10
16 January 2013,Genius is Double-Edged,This film attempts to serve multiple purposes It tells the story of the founding of Facebook employing flashbacks within the context of subsequent lawsuits It s a character study of a peculiar boy genius and his associates and it offers a sociological depiction of elite universities Finally it includes implicit commentary on the mindset of the Digital Generation Aaron Sorkin can write well Some may say that real people don t talk with the rhythm and glibness of Sorkinesque characters In his defense his goal is to entertain first and foremost However it s not unrealistic to attribute great lines of dialogue in clever streams of consciousness to brilliant youth This movie employs many memorable lines and makes us wish we could be half as witty in our daily interactions There has been some criticism that some of the main characters exhibit an eerie coldness I had no problem with that given the fact that the ex girlfriend and the best friend both show signs of warm humanity While Jesse Eisenberg is no stranger to roles as the socially dysfunctional nerd this role required a darker edge and he pulled it off to perfection Particularly driven people are more likely to achieve their dreams than the rest of us and Eisenberg skillfully portray s Zuckerberg s driven nature Congratulations also to the Director for his role in bringing that out in him I particularly enjoyed the shots where the main character is trotting across campus with focused purpose You actually hear the pitter patter of his tiny footsteps to imply his drive Don t overlook the power of loneliness to scale mountains or level buildings Timothy McVeigh the Oklahoma City bomber of 1995 was a deeply frustrated individual Much of that came from his awkwardness with women and his inability to get a girlfriend Apparently girls were at the root of Zuckerberg s drive His ex referred to his project as a video game while rejecting him He immediately steps up his effort to expand presumably to show off for her At one point the Zuckerberg character remarks to his associates that meeting someone of the opposite sex is the motivating factor behind many or most of our decisions in college His best friend gets positive recognition from an elite campus social club and begins a relationship with an Asian girlfriend Eisenberg does a wonderful job of portraying his character s brooding jealousy There is no action per say in this film but it moves quickly We do not see any back story involving the childhood of the characters The father of twin students appears once and the best friend refers to his dad once or twice so it is not entirely one of those movies about kids that seemingly exist without parents There is no reference to Zuckerberg s family We do get a decent shot of San Francisco and feel the contrast between the East and West Coast settings with the use of a swimming pool and a few shots of a suburban street There is no actual sex but we do see a couple of implied sexual encounters What started as an arguably shallow social enterprise evolved into a vehicle for families and friends to stay in touch aritsts to promote their projects businesses to share their latest concepts and thinkers to discuss their ideas Facebook itself can be used for good for evil for vacuous mediocrity and for profane narcissism Zuckerberg has the free will to use his genius for whatever legal means he wishes and we have the free will to use Facebook for whatever legal means we wish I recommend this film for anyone who enjoys quick clever dialogue likes technology or identifies with underdogs,7
26 January 2011,"Wildly overrated, shot in yellow/green pallor with unlikeable characters",I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,3
28 September 2014,Fictionalized but still fascinating portrait of a 21st-century phenomenon,Seems typical of our new century that a product whose original selling point was exclusivity is now being consumed by over a billion people For once Aaron Sorkin s turned out a script where the characters aren t a whole lot smarter and quicker and funnier than any group of people could possibly be cf The West Wing The Newsroom His portrait of Mark Zuckerberg as a geeky outsider who can t relate to women may not have much to do with the real MZ ex captain of the Exeter fencing team who s been in a stable relationship since his sophomore year in college but Jesse Eisenberg does a great job reimagining him as a remote high functioning sociopath who keeps his eyes on the prize at all times Justin Timberlake does even better as Sean Parker the Napster bad boy who made sure that the Facebook stayed cool and didn t sell too many ads for the Harvard bartending course Haven t seen em all but this one seems like Fincher s best since Fight Club And not to worry too much about Eduardo and the Winklevii pitch perfect performances btw looks like they all managed to land on their feet somehow,8
19 July 2019,Necessary inaccuracies,I think this would be a completely different movie if it attempted to be very accurate That s why I view it as mostly fiction not to say that what is shown here is mostly fiction but it is definitely much more stylistic and thematic in its approach than a documentary esque film would be Viewing it like this in my eyes this is a 9 10 I ll go with 9 because I think it should have been more clear about its inaccuracies many people now hold on to this false version of reality,9
28 November 2018,THE SOCIAL NETWORK,Earlier there was an enemy with an idea but they bore a sister and a brother but now we have no connection with the republicans,10
28 March 2020,A compelling watch!,When there was news that David Fincher Director of Fight Club and Se7en was in production of a biopic of Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg it certainly peaked a lot of interest and curiosity Focusing on the creation of Facebook by Zuckerberg in his early years played here by Jesse Eisenberg and the rise and fall of his collaboration with friend Eduardo Andrew Garfield it s a really gripping and engaging thesis on morality and the importance of true human interaction in which the dramatisation of this story depicts very thoughtfully After watching I was intrigued on what Zuckerberg actually thought of this biopic as it doesn t paint him in a particularly bright light I see it as more of a dramatisation than an actual account of real events whether they were or not and its themes are explored masterfully It made a star out of writer Aaron Sorkin who previously had written A Few Good Men went on the direct Molly s Game and write the equally brilliant biopic Steve Jobs The quickfire dialogue instantly draws you in from the beginning in which you have to really pay attention to what the characters are saying but the flow becomes second nature once you re engrossed in the story Beautifully scored by Trent Reznor Nine Inch Nails and Atticus Ross who have worked on Fincher s works ever since it s a really powerful soundtrack that is at times darkly groovy try the track A Familiar Taste experimentally fun their version of In The Hall Of The Mountain King and incredibly tense Gentle Hum Of Anxiety Performance wise Eisenberg and Garfield are great Jesse particularly shines in a lawsuit scene where Mark is losing patience with everyone around him Garfield s performance is measured perfectly and builds up to breaking point towards the end where his character finally says what he needs to say It s directed with a non fussy and straight to the point eye stylish but unpretentious Fincher has a very distinctive almost gothic look to his films while remaining very natural A career highlight for many of the filmmakers involved,9
13 June 2020,The Social Network - 77,A amazing character selection and performance by both new and old stars like Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake Which result in an very interesting in depth biography of how a Harvard student created one of the most profitable business idea of the 21 century Facebook But you already knew the majority of the story of Facebook and while It is nicely directed and entertaining to watch it on film it wasn t that enthralling In addition the story didnt get me as emotionally pumped as it could have been thus it didn t add up do much in the end,7
6 April 2020,Movie hasn't aged well,This movie is pretty much about the first years of Facebook when it was pretty much a cleaner version of Myspace and more open to free speech While it was well made it was made much too early Facebook a few years after this movie got made has pretty much gone down the dumps Whether it s left wing political bullying by friends utterly uninformed right wingers spreading misinformation moderators punishing users with up to 30 day bans it s a site with one foot in the grave I really don t understand Facebook s rationale for who gets banned and who doesn t I know some crazy people who never get banned while I get banned for speaking my mind about community issues The Zuckerberg in this movie would have been horrified at what is going on now If he did this at the beginning Facebook wouldn t have taken off It would have gone down Now they are a giant enterprise and can basically run anyone out of the business There is no competition No one will go use the competition It s a sad state of affairs I haven t used or participated in social media for years It was nice while it lasted but I can see that people are tired of it and it s a fad that has passed I don t know how well Facebook is doing I still get asked to friend people on the site but I keep telling them I don t use it anymore Kids in high school still use it although kids at some schools claim they don t Some of these kids do nothing but post fights and violent stuff on there but while I get banned for sharing what I observe everyday at work no wacky controversial opinions they are free to do this with few repercussions The site is garbage When it has to shut down I will throw a party If a sequel is made it will have to detail how Zuckerberg let power get to his head and ruin a good thing,5
28 November 2010,A film which superbly defines our generation today while also telling a great origin story.,Sometimes you can tell whether or not you re watching a good film by either looking at your watch and wondering whether or not the film is going to end soon The Social Network is a brilliant film because I didn t check my watch not even once nor did I ponder about when the film was going to end because it was so good I didn t want it to end Many people had doubts about this film before its release A movie about the origins of Facebook the social networking site Eyes were rolled undoubtedly Then as soon as acclaimed filmmaker David Fincher and equally acclaimed screenwriter Aaron Sorkin became attached to the project suddenly the buzz was about Needless to say the film blew away my expectations I can honestly say that this has got to be the best acting ensemble I ve see all year Jesse Eisenberg is just astounding as Mark Zuckerberg the arrogant frank calculative and very sarcastic but non the less super smart protagonist The character is written in a way that it doesn t resemble the clich Hollywood nerd hero Zuckerberg in this movie is a cold manipulative jerk in some moments of the film But like all humans he is flawed he has a personality and Eisenberg portrays that flawed side of him with confidence and with a huge dose of wit to boot Andrew Garfield also gives a nuanced performance as Zuckerberg s ex best friend Eduardo Saverin whose performance ranges from cocky to quiet calm and finally outrage The Winklevoss twins are played to cocky perfection by Armie Hammer a feat considering it s one actor playing two characters and he does a fantastic job at both of the characters various degrees The rest of the youthful cast all deserve praise Justin Timberlake Max Minghella Brenda Song and Rooney Mara Heck Eisenberg and Garfield should definitely get Oscar nominations at the very least for their performances and the entire cast among the finest of young acting talent today deserves a Screen Actors Guild Award The screenplay another aspect of the film which I love is filled to the brim with fantastic dialog and with great coherence to boot Every line feels natural the actors that speak them breathe life and fresh air into them and it pulls you even further into this story which is already being done justice by the acting Sorkin gives solid footing and strength to the story and the dialog just dances around naturally around the audience for them to savor every moment that is shown to them similar to Quentin Tarantino movies Sorkin deserves another Oscar nomination because he manages to turn a potentially uninteresting and boring premise into one of the most gripping exhilarating and powerful screenplays of the last decade I m not joking You are pulled into this breakneck world of Zuckerberg and you either enjoy or hate the ride that Sorkin has written out for us Either way it s a hell of an experience Which comes to the question does David Fincher deserve another Oscar nomination for this film Undeniably It is under his superb direction that the actors bring their best to their roles and the screenplay given such life Not once did the film feel contrived or clich d even though it s a true story and we expect it to be We are curious to know what happens next this is the beauty of Fincher s craft Amidst the factors mentioned above as well as the glossy production design the simple yet beautiful cinematography and the slick and very coherent editing Fincher s direction brings this all together under his brilliant supervision This is the work of a master film director at his best and truly his best film since Se7en and Fight Club more than a decade ago That s saying something On an extra note the electronic music score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is just outstanding and brilliant it perfectly suits the situations atmosphere and era of the film and should hearken yet another Oscar nomination the first of its kind Many of us are Facebook users Fact We use it for all kinds of social activities making new friends letting people know what you re up to getting people to know you more and so on The Social Network is an outstanding film which explores the origins of this phenomenon where our protagonist is not an easy character to like moreover he is overcome with friendship lies and betrayal just to get this site up and running We all may had our drama but mostly nothing compared to what Zuckerberg had to face during the entire ordeal The film begins loudly progresses at a breakneck pace and ends quite solemnly and we all feel for him You ll never look at Facebook the same way again after watching this film Since most of us are all obsessed with this social networking and blogging trend it comes to no surprise that this is the film that defines our generation today and it does so with gracefulness and power So far this is my pick for the best film of 2010 And Inception was damn good too Overall rating 94 100,9
22 May 2023,Fantastic script and editing,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,7
23 April 2022,Dishonest movie about a dishonest psychopath,The whole narrative of Mark Zuckerberg inventing facebook is a lie straight out of the box Facebook was a Darpa invention for data mining and Zucks displayed the correct qualities to front it for the elite I e Delusions of grandeur and a high level of psychopathy He was not a genius and a terrible coder and never finished his college degree Anyone with 1600 SAT is a cheat and they often fail when moving on to higher education Very similar traits to Billy Gates both were gifted their products on a silver plate This film is really a fairy tale that attempts to cover the truth and gloss over the cracks This all felt like a giant well made infomercial,3
22 October 2020,"Weather historically accurate or not, absolutely captivating",It has it all not much more I have to say here I keep coming back to this movie,
25 January 2022,Razor sharp,The Social Network is razor sharp Despite its lack of action the film is incredibly fun and engaging First the story is both personal and monumental while the dialogue is extremely witty Each character is potent each plot point builds tension and every scene propels the narrative Plus the subject matter illuminates a major aspect of contemporary life providing significance and social commentary Meanwhile the entire cast is fantastic The material sets a high bar but each main player elevates their role Eisenberg Garfield Timberlake and Hammer all fuel the film with impressive range and subtle complexity Furthermore the technicals of The Social Network are pristine David Fincher is an efficiency master creating weighty atmospheres with minimal flash evoking emotion with empty spaces and shifting moods with minor details Color pallets are thematic yet minute camerawork is powerful yet gentle and composition is clear yet natural The editing swiftly weaves perspectives the sound softly underscores the narrative and the soundtrack is uniquely fitting setting a cold yet modern tone Overall the filmmaking of The Social Network is a phantom force producing a robust experience without revealing itself All together this film is a fountain of craft Writing 10 10 Direction 10 10 Cinematography 9 10 Acting 9 10 Editing 10 10 Sound 9 10 Score Soundtrack 10 10 Production Design 7 10 Casting 9 10 Effects 8 10 Overall Score 9 1 10,9
10 October 2010,Zuckerberg: Deer in the Headlights?,The reviews I had read of The Social Network implied that there was a bad guy but after seeing it tonight I came away feeling that Sorkin had drawn Zuckerberg s character with the compassion and huge brush strokes of insight snappy dialog and ambiguity for which he is famous OK so Zuckerberg made a few mistakes but for the most part he was as much a victim of Facebook as its creator I know I know a rich victim but a victim of his own and others ambitions opportunism and greed Rage anger and frustration are the fuel that fire the world s most brilliant creations add Facebook to the list You can t teach that in B school you can t bottle it you can t aspire to it either You have to live through the hard stuff the rejection the insecurity the primal angst which Zuckerberg had in spades even if Sorkin doesn t beat us over the head with it to gather the kind of motivation required to take a company where Facebook has gone Of course I loved seeing my beloved San Francisco as one of the stars and getting a snapshot of Sean Parker,8
14 February 2021,Reznor score and beautiful cinematography,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,8
14 August 2021,"Who would have thought that the birth of Facebook could be turned into an entertaining film? """,The Social Network makes a point on how a nerd with zero social skills could create the most popular social network of his generation and at the same time explores the interpersonal relationships behind the development of young startup companies The slick cinematography and fast paced dialogues full of sarcastic remarks and one liners turn the least charming subject matter into an intriguing entertainment piece The story is told during two major lawsuits against Zuckerberg through depositions and flashbacks and the point of view of both sides are explored simultaneously Zuckerberg is unexpectedly portrayed as a douchebag but there is a tendency in the script to justify his actions which I was not too fond of,7
6 April 2020,An interesting story but I hate all the characters,POSITIVES 1 Andrew Garfield is Oscar worthy and the only likeable character 2 The Trent Reznor score is iconic 3 The impressive camera movements cinematography NEGATIVES 1 It s hard to get invested when I hate all the characters 2 There s one too many scenes of partying in nightclubs for me,8
18 August 2023,Best picture of 2010,I stopped watching biopics because I usually find them slow and boring I came across this film on netflix and this film was worth a shot It s hugely entertaining and the story is really gripping Those two hours just flew past I didn t even notice That s when I know I really like a film When I just don t notice the time passing The story doesn t just focus on the foundation of Facebook but also ln the conflict between the different parties involved I think what made the film really captivating is the editing because in the film we constantly go back and fourth between the present which is like a legal court and then the past which coincides with the events described at the court Anyway you ll have to watch the film to properly understand but the editing and directing is really good and top that with great performances from Jesse eisinberg and Andrew garfield I m just shocked that the film didn t win best picture and lost to King s speech like no And this film should have at least an 8 rating,10
10 September 2013,Gripping and Illuminating,THE SOCIAL NETWORK is very well filmed and though the dialogue is sometimes a little TOO ultra witty its fine acting helps to bring about an immediate realism It focuses mainly on the legal complications and conundrums i e lawsuits by Zuckerberg s fellow students at Harvard who played big roles in spawning and developing the whole idea of Facebook I never would have dreamed it possible that someone could make a legal drama set mostly in depositions rather than trials work so well but this film accomplishes just that the fact that it s a true story certainly helps It gives a well rounded and convincing picture of the various entanglements Facebook went through in its early stages also effectively showing how just about any large corporation to be experiences similar issues While Zuckerberg is portrayed as less than likable his precocity is hard to ignore and THE SOCIAL NETWORK gives a very non editorialized portrayal of him and all the other players here There s also a lot of Ivy League level girl chasing partying and so forth which again is shown so realistically that it s quite engrossing,8
3 November 2010,A generation whose reality is reflected here in the most ironic of interfaces – through the screen that allows us to see this must-watch zeitgeist film.,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,9
13 June 2023,Cinema Personified: Incredible Movie,Rating 9 5 Incredible Direction Incredible Acting by the cast overall Really enjoyed Andrew Garfield s performance more than Jesse Eisenberg s Incredible to Brilliant Screenplay Incredible Story Brilliant Score Great Cinematography Great Editing The pacing is good for the first half but becomes very rushed in the second half Feels fast but just mimics the nature of a startup but the ending is very abrupt Though that is how it is in the book it is based off of so I cannot fully fault There is a build to a very abrupt ending that is kinda anticlimactic Overall Incredible representation of startup culture and college entrepreneurship overall as this movie will become a classic worth studying in the future,10
15 July 2020,Great script. Great performances. Excellent directing,In my opinion this is the finchers best An excellent script by Sorkin and solid performances from Jesse Eisenberg Andrew Garfield and surprisingly Justin Timberlake There isn t much I can say about this that hasn t already been said Just watch this,8
6 June 2019,endlessly riveting and involving,The Social Network is a truly remarkable movie From the flawlessly structured screenplay to the masterfully executed direction to the pinpoint accuracy of each indelible performance David Fincher was able to create this exceptional film A marvel of world class storytelling on business friendships social media creativity how they all play the biggest roles in modern day society,8
13 November 2010,David Fincher Is God,Mr Fincher I love you and I love you again I have been looking forward to this film since it was announced but I became really really interested when I found out Aaron Sorkin wrote the screenplay who has written many wonderful things including Charlie Wilsons War a little favourite of mine From the beautiful direction to the use of music Trent Reznors score to the use of digital which I m proud to be sold on and glad David Fincher is as well to the incredible performances thanks to Davids numerous takes I am told the opening scene went to 99 takes and it shows beautifully I was hoping this film would have universal themes in the making of something of the now and that s exactly what I got Jesse Eisenberg who is officially one of my fav actors now after seeing him in The Squid and The Whale Adventureland Zombieland I still have to see Rodger Dodger and now this He gives a stellar turn as Mark Zuckerberg An unconventional leading character for a film is not unusual for Fincher Andrew Garfield was excellent and could make a great spider man and I hope he has a long career Rooney Mara was great in all her scenes and I can t wait to see her in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo Justin Timberlake once again proves to be the real deal following his great performances in Alpha Dog and Black Snake Moan he is indeed the real deal David Fincher just goes in the most exciting directions from Alien 3 Se7en The Game Fight Club Panic Room Zodiac The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button and now The Social Network His films are haunting and inspired he is addicted to intelligence and driven to scar his audiences Some have been calling it Finchers best film since Fight Club This can t help me think about how Tyler Durden says Welcome to Fight Club Mark Zuckerberg says Welcome to Facebook Both make me think about what coming into certain worlds does to us in the long run if it will bring good and bad I will adore this film forever,10
14 November 2010,Facebook V/s. Friendship,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,8
18 March 2011,David Fincher's best film which guards his Oscar.,The Social Network appeared to be one of the most anticipated profound films of the year so my expectations for this film were high The Facebook story was a one I had actually never known about and was extremely curious interested to find out more Lastly with David Fincher who had directed so many great and underrated films you couldn t go wrong To tell you I wasn t a tad bit disappointed with the outcome of this film It was actually almost perfect It featured fine performances a sophisticated soundtrack brilliant writing and outstanding direction I wasn t expecting too much from young lads such as Eisenberg Garfield and Timberlake In the end they were all perfect for their roles Eisenberg was strong aggressive and jubilant to show his hidden talent Garfield was even more impressive playing his character with speed expressions and perfection Last but not least Timberlake was actually the weakest Yes he was aggressive and near perfect for his role but at times he just blew it The sophisticated soundtrack was creepy and made me shiver the daylights out of me Reznor and Ross did an excellent job of putting it together The writing was actually the stand out meaning the best category I praised this film for Aaron Sorkin s screenplay seemed hard to follow but the guy did one hell of a job Overall as you can see The Social Network is one of the best films of the year that guard Fincher s deserving Oscar I m just keeping my hopes up for him to get it otherwise it ll be another foolish mistake from the harsh Academy,10
29 June 2020,Justin Timbersucks,This is a very good film Fantastically written fantastic performances from most It s a really interesting story even though Hollywood has taken some liberties with the truthfulness of it It still all feels so real This is because this isn t just a story about Facebook this is a common story of numerous start ups and friendships Entrepreneurs slip up and make mistakes become greedy back stab their friends get in business with fools blow money on foolish things Etc It s a common tale and this movie encapsulates it very well But again no movie is perfect I think they made some poor choices when choosing actors and actresses some of the performances were not good Especially Justin Timberlake and Dakota Johnson man i don t think she is a very good actress at all This movie has an incredible score might I add,9
18 February 2013,The Social Network is sure to interest all Facebook addicts!,I myself have a Facebook but do not often use it I just recently decided to watch this movie as the rumors and reviews surrounding it depicts the movie as great The Social Network focuses around a few high school students It mainly follows one by the name of Mark Zuckerberg who after realizing who after coming to a realization from one of his previous creations called Facemash decides to make the Social Network called The Social Network Haha Now we have a movie The Social Network is interesting for a few good reasons One is the direction of David Fincher the man behind Se7en and Fight Club His direction is superb so is the dialogue Its clever its witty and has some memorable moments The acting is also very strong with Jesse Eisenberg putting up such a strong performance The supporting cast also did an absolutely great job The story to the movie is really interesting the music is good the sound editing and so on A really strong point of the movie is also the characters whom I particularly cared towards To conclude this The Social Network is NOT a must see movie buts its always worth checking out I enjoyed it for Fincher s fantastic direction clever dialogue great acting and great characters to put into a fascinating story,7
31 December 2021,An Honest and Captivating Watch,Receiving 3 Academy Awards The Social Network proved as successful a film as the man who it centres around well almost as successful The film follows the young life of Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg and his world changing invention of Facebook a social networking site Despite its triumph Zuckerberg is faced with human obstacles on his journey to fame and wealth To split this craft of genius into 3 paragraphs it would only be appropriate to comment on the sensational acting performances the cleverly written script and the carefully directed cinematography Firstly Mark Zuckerberg could not have been casted any more convincing than by Jesse Eisenberg who encapsulates the protagonists awkward nature incredible intelligence and humorous wit Nominated for Best Actor at the 2011 Oscars only to be beaten by Colin Firth Eisenberg produces his greatest acting performance to date and it really is an on screen treat Supporting Zuckerberg s movement is Eduardo a fellow Harvard attendee portrayed by Andrew Garfield who demonstrates the driving force and wide scope of knowledge that helps lift the uprise of the social networking site Garfield is composed and articulate in his acting he is controlled in his actions and engaging in his speech capturing the true personality of Zuckerberg s right hand man Secondly Aaron Sorkin manipulates the perfectly toned script like a puppeteer of words Ensuring serious confrontations are dramatic passive aggressive disputes are comical and moments of tech brilliance are smooth justifying his Academy Award for Best Writing Adapted Screenplay Finally The Social Network will undoubtedly go down historically as a David Fincher classic the sequence of Mark and Eduardo updating Facebook in their uni dorm as well as the fly on the wall approach at many conference rooms involving Zuckerberg reflecting the progressive and coming of age story that is radiated to a cinema crowd enhancing the 2010 picture a true great As I said 3 minor elements that collectively contribute to 1 major hit,9
9 May 2012,"""You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies""",When I first heard they were making a film about Facebook I literally laughed out loud I ve seen some interesting documentaries but a movie about a overrated social networking site No Then someone told me about David Fincher directing it That immediately sparked up my interest He s a favorite of mines with film classics such as Fight Club But again a movie about a website I ve never heard the story beforehand and at first glance it could be done so boring My fears were obvious Then I saw the trailer It looked fantastic albeit the fact it was about a social networking site I really couldn t picture David Fincher directing this but it seriously did intrigue me It blew all my expectations AWAY The thing I liked was how narratively brilliant it was David Fincher made it easy to follow with clever twist and turns to make it entertaining to see That was another fear of mine it would be boring as ever But David Fincher can t do that The acting was simply some of the best acting I ve ever seen Jesse Eisenberg was genius His awkward fast talking character was perfected He has this thing where he fits into a character without getting into himself The one that surprised me was Andrew Garfield which this was my first film with him in it He plays his character as good as Jesse Eisenberg if not better The screenplay was some of my favorite parts With the character of Jesse alongside his sarcastic behavior you are sure to laugh And it s not like laugh out loud funny it was clever funny The one where you ll secretly smile at it s secretive snide remarks The score deserves it s recognition When you first hear it you re going to be like this is like a horror film score and you re rightly so It fit the film in the strangest way and made it seem way different then it could ve been I loved it And the directing the combination of all these things THE FILM was just brilliant This is a David Fincher masterpiece and is surely a favorite of his The film might not compete with the greatest films of all time but it deserves to be recognized as one of the best of the decade I recommend for anybody who saw it and thought as I had It blew away my expectations and I m 95 sure it will blow yours away too With the near perfected directing acting score and overall atmosphere makes this a near masterpiece 10 10,10

6 December 2018,"""I like standing next to you, Sean. It makes me look so tough.""",The Social Network to this day still encompasses in my mind possibly the most well inscribed screenplay of all time Fincher and Sorkin have managed to make seemingly the most mundane anecdote into the most dramatic prodigious loosely based on a true story cutthroat tale of the 21st Century Verdict A,10
17 October 2010,Felt nothing,Felling nothing to me is the sign of a bad film personally I think that s why I go to the movies to feel excitement sadness joy horror humor whatever The Social Networks showed rich aholes being aholes to each other I found not a single character to root for and it felt that nothing was at stake not really Even their friendship wasn t made out to be any great thing in the beginning before it all went upside down Sure it was interesting in a news article kind of way but it was souless Was that the point I doubt it and if so so what Add to that the worst CGI cold breath and falling snow that wouldn t look out of place in a cartoon and you have a film that seems to be over hyped because it involves recent events My prediction It will not be remembered so fondly in cinema history Fincher hasn t made a truly great film in over 10 years Maybe The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo will find him back on form We can hope,5
17 September 2011,Highly entertaining -and you don't have to be on Facebook to enjoy it!,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,

2 October 2010,Did I adequately answer your condescending question?,David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin form a cinematic union to tell the story about the founders of the social networking website Facebook Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg is an eccentric and brilliant Harvard undergrad who intellectually and fundamentally creates the social networking site we all know and love Facebook The Social Network is a dramatization of the creation of Facebook but also the civil case s Zuckerberg went through to create the one of the biggest sites in the world that is worth billions of dollars and is used by over 500 million people across the world But to make 500 million friends Zuckerberg had to make a few enemies The Social Network is an absorbing film that makes you question yourself What is Facebook It s a philosophical question that essentially bridges the gap More like chasm between the sides of baby boomers and the sides of Gen X and Y ers and stimulates meaningful discussions about viewpoints ideas and values This is a very talky film but thankfully the dialogue is excellent and Aaron Sorkin A Few Good Men Charlie Wilson s War pens an exceptional screenplay that will likely get an Oscar nomination And perhaps even a win Besides a fantastic script the film is beautifully directed by David Fincher Fight Club Se7en who paces a talky 2 hour film while keeping the audience more than just entertained He also directs a fine cast all members of the cast give their best performances to date Jesse Eisenberg especially gives an astonishingly sophisticated performance of calculated detachment Every movement he makes is a stimulating one he makes you laugh and happy and at times makes you hate him and question his morals The rest of the cast is solid as well particularly Andrew Garfield who is a star in the making as well as Justin Timberlake who proved that his breakout performance in 2007 s Alpha Dog was not a one time thing He can definitely act A lot of people were not sure what to expect of The Social Network It really doesn t matter whether you love or hate Facebook or even have one Cinematically it is a great film It is a ballsy and risky first effort by Fincher and Sorkin which turns out to be rather brilliant and controversial Many people are wondering how factually accurate the film is The Social Network reminds me of the Rise and Fall narrative of the gangster film narrative with Networking being the subject of the rise and fall More directly the film is a lot like Citizen Kane with our protagonist who infuriates us and pleases us at the same time reaches the heights of the communications empire This film isn t for everyone It requires thought and I foresee some people being bored by it Mainly the average ADD movie goer who isn t entertained unless they see an explosion or hear a one liner every three minutes It s flashy entertaining funny and interesting Unlike Facebook itself The Social Network has little to no flaws and is well worth friending Rating 8 10,9
5 September 2011,Shockingly powerful and entertaining,I m not sure that there has been a more intelligent timely and entertaining movie in recent years as David Fincher s brilliant The Social Network Anchored by Fincher s breakneck pacing the impressive performances the moving electronic musical score and Aaron Sorkin s crackling Oscar winning screenplay If I had been told two years ago that a movie based on the founding of Facebook would be this good I would have scoffed In fact the very idea of this movie was off putting to me but it is so much better than it has any right to be In fact this movie was ten times more entertaining than any big budget action movie all year Read my full review at http themuddoctor blogspot com 2011 08 social network html,
1 October 2010,21st Century Wall Street at it's finest,Over a year ago is when i first heard the news that David Fincher one of my personal favorite directors was taking the helm at directing a full length feature on the orgins of how Facebook came to be At first i was crossed Fincher making a movie about facebook Sounds a little gay if you ask me Then i heard that Justin Timberlake was now on board Then i really started to question Mr Finchers true motives But as time rolled on i read more of the details about the production and the fact that Trent Reznor had now signed on to conduct the musical score made the views i had of this film change drastically I am truly in limbo with this movie it could honestly go either way Did you ever see the Oliver Stone movie W You know the one about George Bush Well even though the movie wasn t spectacular i thought that it did i fine job of focusing on the material rather than looking to point fingers And that is exactly what this movie accomplished Rather than wield a hatchet and accuse people of being a bunch of cry babies all it does is observe everything with a microscope and it does it in the grandest fashion Attention to detail is no new thing to David Fincher He has already proved his worth with Zodiac probably the most detailed and accurate serial killer movie ever made so it s really no surprise for him to repeat the same process with this movie Once you get past the incredibly fast paced dialog and computer phrases that i have never even heard of you slowly get sucked into the story And it s kind of hard not to I mean almost everyone we know does Facebook so in a strange little way we can all relate to it and we are intrigued by how it all started But this film doesn t rely on that In fact i totally forgot that it was even a facebook movie at times The story is very fast paced and doesn t have one scene that makes you shift in your seat due to boredom And to me there are two reasons why this movie was pulled off First the script is pure genius It s smart it s funny it s serious and still maintains this constant intelligence It would be a major shocker if this wasn t nominated for best adapted screenplay let alone with the category And second is the acting To me Jesse Eisenberg was always that guy who try too hard to be like Michael Cera but i kid you not when i say that he has probably put on the best performance i have seen so far this year As of right now he is my front runner for best actor of the year Secondly i would like to extend my apologies for ever doubting Justin Timberlake s ability Yes i thought he did a great job in Alpha Dog but i still had some doubts but i now regret ever thinking them He really went above and beyond in this Bottom Line yep the movie is damn good I wouldn t say it s the best movie i have seen so far this year But it certainly deserves to be in the top 5 But even if you somehow find this movie to be a bit dull you should still go just so you have something to compare other movies to at the Oscars because this movie will probably be getting a ton of nominations,9
3 May 2020,A Very Entertaining Life Story,The Social Network tells the story of how Facebook was created It seems like it should be just a lot of boring geniuses arguing over code but it ends up being a super interesting story With excellent acting and dialogue the movie grips you immediately and it never lets you go this movie is as fast paced as the way Zuckerburg talks The Social Network is a movie that I recommend to people who enjoy dialogue focused films,8

10 November 2010,An interesting insight into how Facebook came about,This movie in my honest opinion is a little too long its extremely boring at times with the tedium of litigation fought out in a boardroom but nonetheless engrossing engaging and interesting and lets face it who doesn t use Facebook nowadays Imagine if they made a similar movie about Bill Gates and the creation of Microsoft It is also interesting to note from here that David Fincher was the Director behind Benjamin Button Fight Club and Seven all good movies in their own right This is also a very good movie but as others have said it is just that good trying too hard to be great I have got to say that the main character portrayed for creating Facebook in the movie is extremely annoying throughout Very obnoxious and offensive and I felt sorry for the two guys who worked with him in the Facebook set up Justin Timberlake steals the show to some extent as Napsters Sean Parker impeccable acting as an actor he never fails to deliver I quite believe that the drift of the story in the film is accurate but there are clearly changes to create a drama If the real lives story are followed then there should be no drama for us to enjoy and it is the drama which makes the film for me not the actual telling of the Facebook story which was thrown in for good measure We can all watch this and think wow what if I had thought of that simple concept back in the Autumn of 2003 but then again would I really want such a life changing experience which would jeopardise my relationship with family and friends The movie is flawed in a number of basic areas I assume nobody gets into Harward without some academic and family qualifying criteria but this is never mentioned in the movie unlikely the twins who are clearly guys from a family with money More than once the point is made that the guy has become the youngest billionaire on earth and that he was ruthless in his determination to execute his plan and get Facebook online to the cost of friends and perhaps family connections With this in mind as others have said the film should have objectively explained to us how the Facebook website could come to be so valued by such a high figure after such a short time Certainly Sean Parker speculated during the movie but this was way short of figures being talked about in litigation This was a dangerous film to watch in some ways and yet worth watching a second time to comb the dialogue which was constant throughout Dangerous because we might be wrongly inspired by its message and perhaps even distrusting of the purpose of a social networking site I always enjoy insight films and I enjoyed this one despite anything I say which may be construed as negative The opening scene between the guy and the girlfriend was incredibly tedious and could have been considerably shortened but never mind that maybe that is the screenplay writer trying to score early points for an Oscar nomination Not an Oscar movie for me but its a very credible movie overall,7
15 January 2011,The Curious Idea of Mark Zuckerberg,This film makes you think but more than thinking about anything in particular it makes you remember Much like remembering your introduction to the website itself you ll never forget watching this movie I remember first hearing of the movie I m on another website TheInternetMovieDatabase drop the the and I was where you are now I was worried about the future of liberty in art seeing that David Fincher was making another PG 13 movie I was ignorant When I see Tarantino get caught by commercialism I ll be back to talk but not before I see why Neither here nor there some movies deserve bigger audiences Much like Pulp Fiction the nonparallel storytelling is propelled by pages upon pages of dialog and we eat it up You re dropped onto the Harvard campus in The Thirsty Scholar if that s the name of the place where we re placed further more into the brutal final moments of Zuckerberg s best human relationship in the movie As brutal as it gets you re paying attention as if you re sitting with the couple amongst the noisy thirsty scholars When the noise fades out an angry tone fades in but under an almost childlike melody of only three notes This is our main title and our main theme We ll hear it again and then again but it means something different each time If you listened during that opening scene then you re ready to pay attention They introduce not only the idea of who Mark Zuckerberg is at least the character but introduce the reason behind the idea Mark Zuckerberg gets The best scene is the second time we hear the sweet melody Mr Zuckerberg do I have your full attention The questioner becomes a blur and the questionee is in focus It s raining This is movie making At its finest This is dialog At its finest Also brought to our attention is Aaron Sorkin the man behind The West Wing and A Few Good Men one of the most powerful plays you ll ever see The power is fully on here If only life could be so perfect as to have our daily conversations be dialog written by Sorkin For those of you not paying attention you ll become aware of David Ficher The man behind your two all time favorite films Fight Club and Seven The two disk special edition is worth more than what you pay for especially if you bought the Blu ray version on Amazon when it first came out The second disk allows your eyes to be open behind the scenes in a very entertaining documentary but even so you ll be able to enjoy the movie again and again I d say its one you can easily watch over and over like Siskel and Ebert said about Pulp Fiction since the film isn t told in chronological order just a logical order It s as if you re watching the film for the first time every time The Social Network is the best film of 2010 and has been said to be the best film of the past decade Its rare that we watch something perfect but this movie is fireworks It s refreshing that we don t need bombs explosions violence or gore to be entertained Take a look at the previous year s best picture winner The Hurt Locker It had all the things I just mentioned but they are honorable mentions when it comes to that one The Social Network is not necessarily about Facebook but it will last longer than the website does You won t forget it,10
20 May 2020,Good storyline and very interesting,Surprisingly this movie was actually really good was very interesting to know how Facebook got created The start of the film was a little slow and boring but as it went on it got better Social network had a great cast and Jesse Eisenberg was absolutely brilliant in playing the part So if anyone is reading this give it a chance it s a good film,7
12 June 2013,More great cinema from Fincher,When we sit down at our computers in the morning our hair disheveled with a thunderous bowlful of Rice Krispies what do we do next That s right we head straight for the internet and more than likely any number of websites that connect us in some way with our fellow earthlings Chances are that one of the stops on our internet itineraries will be Facebook the social networking site that we have all helped to develop into a worldwide phenomenon However like the human race trapped in The Matrix we tend not to ask questions of where the things we use in our daily lives come from Facebook falls into that list of cherished pieces of our lives it is hard to imagine a world without the internet let alone Facebook There are incredible stories behind even the most common and essential facets of our culture and the same goes for our beloved Facebook Behind the friend count competitions the ridiculous cat memes and the half naked pictures of our favorite drunk coed Sally is a fascinating origin tale that is worthy of a superhero or super villain depending on who you ask That my dear friend counts is the spirit of director David Fincher s 2010 cinematic splash The Social Network While the film takes many creative liberties with the story of Facebook mastermind Mark Zuckerberg fittingly played by Jesse Eisenberg and his rise to ten digit immortality The Social Network is by no means an unwatchable pile of bloated hyperbole and special effects Instead David Fincher presents us with a film that oozes charisma and atmosphere created in no small part by the witty pistol quick dialogue and dead eye acting The set designs are carefully drab underplaying the glamorous associations with such idealized places as Harvard and Beverly Hills These elements help to draw us into Zuckerberg s world one that thrives on gossip greed betrayal sex and everything else in the Sean Parker Justin Timberlake handbook wait a minute that sounds an awful lot like the real world doesn t it The Social Network is completely self aware calling into question everything that is presented at face value including the superficiality of social networking and even us Even the soundtrack composed by Trent Reznor Nine Inch Nails and Atticus Ross is an exercise in artificiality the keyboards weave an intricate world wide web of ear candy featuring a plethora of beeps and boops mixed with icy flourishes of piano and guitar This sonic formula although unorthodox for a young person rises to the top despite an x number of setbacks movie perfectly captures the heart of The Social Network s story as it glides throughout the scenes always present and poignant but never distracting On the whole The Social Network does not necessarily break any boundaries in terms of plot nor is it the first film to question a staple of American culture but it does not have to The film takes what many films attempt to do and does it much better and it is sure to create a buzzing discussion over French fries and coffee at many a restaurant or living room and quite a few Facebook status updates as well,8
23 July 2020,Engaging.,Oh the good old FB Those were the days Mark is really obnoxious I had assumed him to be a very polite and soft spoken person Well I had only seen few of his FB posts around 2010 So this film is quite not what I expected it to be,8
13 July 2011,Heavily adapted but brilliant story,I ve become a big David Fincher fan over the the years and I ve come to expect something when i see his name linked to a film a certain sense of dark witty humour mixed with subtle clever storytelling and a sense of rebellion that always make the films different from the others available at the time When i watched the Social network i really didn t know what to expect but wanted typical fincher trademarks and in a way i was disappointed with the lack of darkness about the film i wanted a tale of betrayal and deceit displayed on screen however i was not disappointed as it was replaced by a film that showed us the emotion between the characters involved with a lot of comic relief which is always witty and never resorts to American slapstick we find so much these days which i believe only children under the age of ten still enjoy but Hollywood still insist on producing What the makers of this film have managed to do is make a documentary into a vivid and in depth story with drama and emotion that all audiences can relate to I do worry however that the screen play is so good that large amounts of the story have been added to make the film flow and add aspects about character and storyline which in turn has been at the cost of the truth of the situation around the actual creation of facebook Even to the extent that the real life actors counterparts in some cases refused to help in the making of the film as they felt it was not accurate or true to their real life personalities Finally the film offers us one very confusing scene in which there is a rowing race in the UK which seems as though it has been agreed to be added as a favour by fincher to a cinematographer as it does not seem to fit in with the pacing or storyline of the film at all but contains some brilliant looking shots and aesthetics to the extent of a cinematographers wet dream,8
15 October 2010,very delightful and intelligent writing,Greatly written the story is very well carried The plot is quite simple but the characters are complex and interesting and these mixed give the movie a thoughtful questioning about ambition ego audacity friendship and its pendant betrayal and business In other words it gives you great views and insights on how a legend is born Because let s reckon it Mark Zuckerberg will enter history if he as not already done it In the end I went out thinking who cares if he did right things or not this guy changed things and is to be remembered whether like or not Really this is worth the price of the ticket,9
30 December 2019,Great Story!,Review The Social Network is a biographical drama film directed by David Fincher It is based on Ben Mezrich s 2009 book The Accidental Billionaires Who would have thought a movie based off the creation of Facebook would be entertaining let alone of the best movies of 2010 On a fall night in 2003 Harvard undergrad and computer programming genius Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg sits down at his computer and heatedly begins working on a new idea In a fury of blogging and programming what begins in his dorm room as a small site among friends soon becomes a global social network and a revolution in communication A mere six years and 500 million friends later Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history but for this entrepreneur success leads to both personal and legal complications All the performances in the movie are great Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg who has a fast paced nerdy kind of jerk ish attitude and Andrew Garfield is his best friend found me rooting for him through the whole film even more than Mark Justin Timberlake does a decent job but is lost among the other performances The direction comes from David Fincher who has had variable success all the way from Alien 3 to Se7en but here he is right on form with a flashy but tightly structured presentation that never fails to command your attention and interest The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat which is crazy given the context of the film Only Fincher could make that happen Overall the movie keeps your attention throughout with great performances and an intriguing story It shows different sides of one story and how much it took to get Facebook off the ground 4 5 5,9
24 May 2011,"Great story, from great director",I think this is the best movie made by David Fincher since Fight Club when i first saw The Social Network it was kind of boring listening to all those lawyers talking about the same thing all the time but then i saw it for second time and liked it more the movie contains really good dialogs and of course the scrip is perfect Actors weren t very good but still the movie is good The history of one of the worlds biggest companies is very interesting to see and isn t boring at all the movie shows how friends can make decisions how they see what s right and what s wrong there is friendship argue love and betrayal in just 2 hours which is filmed directed and edited very well For me this was the best movie of the year King s speech is quite a good movie but it can be watched once or twice but social network is the movie that never makes me fell tired of watching it from a great book was made a great script and from that script Fincher made a movie which would be interesting entertaining and good to see the music in the movie is also very good it fits with the movie so well that you re just getting pleasure both with watching and listening to it The social network shows that money isn t the most important in life it shows how a person get a lot of money and power and at that time lose friends and make more enemies The movie is very good to see if you ve not seen this movie yet don t miss it just because of the fancy actors,10
7 October 2010,You gotta 'like' this!,A nerdy Harvard student blabbers on about numerous topics with his girlfriend whom he also chooses to ignore eye contact with while being inattentive to her reactions and responses Understandably she blocks him while calling him an hole The dejected nerd blogs his agony out in distaste about his girlfriend and then creates a site for ranking girls from college thereby creating the platform that would shape the future of everyone s communication It was from that spark of social rejection that the Social Network got ignited David Fincher s glorious record of captivating movies Fight Club Se7en and that curious case leaves fans with great anticipation from a bio epic about Facebook Based on Ben Mezrich s The Accidental Billionaires and screen written by Aaron Sorkin The Social Network is a powerhouse of a movie with superlative performances and adroit direction together providing an exhilarating experience From Adventureland comes this incredible actor Jesse Eisenberg who plays Mark Zuckerberg in his college days when the inception of Facebook occurred The film revolves around Eisenberg portraying the nerdy entrepreneur whose intellect and creativity surpass his peers Alienation in this form acts as a catalyst towards his goals and the whip like dialogue delivery together with the portrayal of a focused persona make this a commendable act Providing the emotional enrichment with his soulful performance is Andrew Garfield playing Eduardo Mark s best friend and Facebook s CFO whose wit and intuition are only undone by his vulnerability Garfield is simply brilliant with his emotions and as a sufferer in this tale of greed he is responsible for balancing the otherwise stone cold attitudes from others While it is the duo s unyielding ambition that confronts the Winklevoss brothers who threatened to shut down the social network they couldn t invent it was their innocence that Sean Parker seized to gain his leverage in facebook s exponential growth Justin Timberlake is the phenomenon in this network While playing the co founder of Napster who convinces Zuckerberg to push Facebook across continents he emphasizes that greed fuels growth and their combined intelligence would make them icons of tomorrow The most explosive scenes are with him in the restaurant where they meet for the first time and then at the night club when he speaks to Mark over the blaring music The dialogues are essentially the summation of what facebook eventually becomes Justin s ease in carrying out this mesmerizing role has much to do with his showmanship in music videos and stage The distinction in the principles of the three protagonists is striking and without any bloodshed the movie delineates invisible scars wrought by money zeal and betrayal upon them David Fincher had no cast of repute to work with Instead he did what his profile demanded of him He directed the actors toward the brilliant screenplay thus drawing closer the gaps between a docu drama and a page turning bio epic With every new idea that crosses Zuckerberg s mind while he s still implementing the previous idea while Parker urges him to think bigger and while the Winklevi plot to overthrow Zuckerberg s reign over social networking anxiety and curiosity abound as indeed we all like to know the origins of our current networking portal The movie is a verbal ball game with several intense confrontations between the actors that will make the DVD purchase worthwhile Fincher and writer Sorkin with their profound talents have delivered one of the best movies in recent years The cinematography is outstanding with apt lighting and angles that convey everything without a word being said The visual effects that enabled one actor to play the twins is also stunning while the background score enhanced every potent scene Behind the veil of being a facebook movie we have young ambition backed with business shrewdness that catapults to phenomenal success only after betraying a best friend and partner The apt ending of Zuckerberg sitting alone in an office in front of his laptop screen awaiting a response from a friend request showcases the irony of ironies The Social Network might appeal more to the younger crowds most of whom would be avid facebook users This exemplary drama flashed back during Zuckerberg s legal trial is so scintillating real and engaging that its poke will warrant a like from you,9
21 May 2012,What this generation has come to be?,When you picture a villain in your mind I guess the most convenient way is to think up a hideous face and put the many undesirable qualities in your opinion behind that face so he would speak the same awful languages you ve come to be familiar with I wouldn t be surprised if the portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg in this movie was come up in this fashion With 95 100 on Metacritic 3 Oscars and so much hype The Social Network can be called a monumental success in Hollywood David Fintcher may have again proved that he is not only a storytelling master but also a mastermind of medias as evidenced by the convoluted nature of the Social Network project and the explosive media coverages after wards I believe this movie will be discussed analyzed and staying in its controversial status for the next decade I for one am totally compelled to find out about the real Zuckerberg However such interests only garnered me more curiosity in digging deeper about him After all the aftertaste of watching a big screen villainous main protagonist is strong especially if such a figure feels like your unfriendly neighbor who is in possession of similar uh admirable qualities Liked I said I wouldn t be surprised to find out that the real life Zuckerberg is quite friendly and easy to get along with However the real issue here is how I should live with the fact that as a fellow geek nerd would what Zuckerberg wants to say be similar to what I want to say Having been following the discussion board here I cannot help but notice that people are generally offended and raging out against Mr Z portrayed in this movie pulling no punches in calling him douche bag self absorbed and so on Some also said he s probably autistic and even aspergers Moreover some went on to say that being autistic doesn t justify what Mr Z has done in the movie which I totally agree But still under all these fancy terms these extravagant wrappings what would Zuckerberg feel Is he really comfortable with being a modern day Butch Cassidy aka a role model for renegades and rebels Thus I remembered a time where all people felt compelled to justify themselves to their subjects The rich wished to justify his wealth either by appearances of hard working or good heritage the religious would wish to justify themselves by their deeds as holy as possible while rebels generally overlooked or lived in the limbo created by other people s justifications If Mr Z was a 1st century Jew actually he s a 21st century Jew he would most likely end up as someone like the prodigal son in the Bible s Prodigal Son Parable instead of the billionaire he is now The sheer difference of these two outcomes drives me to ask if Mr Z in the movie a rebel and a billionaire felt the need to justify himself Or more personally to us commoners would he feel totally free and more evoluted if he reaches a point of completely no need to justify himself when he s crowned with all these paramount achievements To my disappointment when I saw his business card which said I am Mark Zuckerberg Bixxx I knew instantly he was still compelled to justify himself and his legacy just like the old fashioned religions This business card is essentially saying I am the Lord of this business and this is my Ten Commendaments for you which is actually only One commandments that I AM Mark Z and you re my Bixxx Why is that Aside from raising more brows and attract more medias wouldn t 2 Billion dollars have made him feel safe already that he needs stunts like this That s when I realized that the sheer irony for people like Sean Parker and Mr Z in the movie is that they went so far in denying their religious nature and the fact that by saying something like This is our generation our rules they re essentially creating new religions for both themselves and the others The prodigal son in the Bible despite his rebelliousness and reckless childish behaviors to destroy himself saw no point in gratifying his own namesake or writing down his own legacy and epics However we modern people are so into raging against the old values and creating our own that when something backfires at us to make us feel there are after all something wrong with the whole idea we are only left in a position to regret or like Mr Z did in the movie expressing his contempt to the judge and jury The movie ended with the friendship between the two lead roles presumably broken forever while the lawyer got some insight into Zuckerberg s deeply troubled self which he seldomly leak to his 500 million Facebook friends Once a friend of mine told me that justification is for reconciliation at least that s what happened in the Prodigal Son parable that the Father reconciled beautifully with his prodigal son The Bible told me that whether you re an authentic A hole or just someone who tries very hard to be one you re welcome to accept Jesus love and be reconciled with him I truly wish Mr Z and Saverin can be reconciled in a graceful fashion too,8
18 November 2012,Too bad for a flawed script,The reason why such a great movie can only deserve a mere 5 star is because of a MAJOR flaw scriptwriting Knowing a little bit about Mark Zuckerberg and as an engineering student who had spent time with geeks and hardcore programmer back in university days I can say for sure that this movie just showed how much lack of understanding it has towards the true nature of Zuckerberg His character portrayal is totally wrong it is not wrong to have a strong enthusiasm and confidence or arrogance behaviour but it is not right that the movie portrayed him in such a way like everything he did or would do in the future is fueled not purely out of passion but more like of a vengeful nature Programmers no matter how arrogant they are do not behave like that His face shows anger all the time even Eduardo look more like the geek These are not just my own opinions Please read the REAL Mark Zuckerberg s own opinions about this movie he just summarized all the aforementioned and if the original still living billionaire was that unhappy on a film about him that s enough for a low rating from me and what is with the addition of a break up with girlfriend who is not real that rubbish ending just for the sake of adding some Hollywood flavour For a script that is ADAPTED from a book come on is that all it can do David Fincher do you make movies to please yourself or to stay true to the person who allow you to reveal his story to the world,5
21 October 2010,The infamous story behind Facebook,I have to admit When I first heard of this movie I basically could not believe that a flick based on a story of a computer nerd who invented the biggest social website can be really interesting After seeing the trailer it came to me the Facebook in fact is just a device that generates the old as our world motifs of friendship betrayal greed and need to belong Just then I wanted to see it so badly to be reassured that my vision is correct And I was not disappointed This two hour movie takes the viewer on a ride which can surely be attached to a thriller or action genre It certainly is unconventional for a classic biopic The rapid dialogues written by Aaron Sorkin are the daisies of this picture They make you feel like you are in a room with the Harvard geniuses themselves What is more we finally see Jesse Eisenberg Mark Zuckerberg CEO and the wit behind Facebook arise from the shadow of Michael Cera giving us one of the best acts in his career Right after Jesse we get brilliant performances made by Andrew Garfield Eduardo Saverin CFO the deserted one and Rooney Mara the girl who dumps Mark and is a direct cause of Mark s creation Moreover listen carefully to the original score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross back pins and needles delivered I will not reveal the plot but I can assure that most of the audience will be delighted Now just to reaffirm my point I gave The Social Network 10 10 because honestly I have to say that this is so far the best movie of the year 2010 and it will for sure fight for an Oscar or two and will be remembered as one of the best flicks about networking in history,10
24 June 2022,Just as good the second time,Even while watching on an airplane this movie was captivating It s a very interesting story and Andrew Garfield is amazing as always I d highly recommend this to pretty much anyone,10
25 February 2011,The Phenom of THE SOCIAL NETWORK,As a chronicle of events leading to the creation of the social networking site Facebook touching nearly every computer user in the world The Social Network is a fascinating take on Mark Zuckerberg a maverick whose brilliant mind is matched by his arrogance Directed by David Fincher Se7en The Fight Club from an excellent screenplay by Aaron Sorkin A Few Good Men The West Wing and based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich this is a fascinating study of a success story complete with intrigue and subterfuge In this case the incidents play on a very human level You would think this would make an excellent made for television HBO movie but Sorkin and Fincher have created a remarkable cinematic vision of an inventor albeit a troubled one In the fall of 2003 Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg is portrayed as a computer genius at Harvard University with few social graces What we know now as Facebook had its modest beginnings as a response to a failed relationship with a girl Needing to vent some anger Mark modifies a campus website and with the help of his buddy Eduardo Andrew Garfield a concept is born for socializing on the internet When web traffic to the site spikes to record numbers people begin to take notice and a phenomenon is born A group of Harvard students enlist Mark to develop his site with their financial backing but when they discover that he is working on his venture without them they become incensed and contemplate legal action Mark and Eduardo become popular rock stars on campus as the new Facebook spreads like an epidemic to other college campuses like Yale Columbia and Stanford Soon the company approaches critical mass and the milestone of being able to monetize the site and turn a profit Napster creator Sean Parker Justin Timberlake reaches out to the growing network because he understands its vast potential Mark becomes enamored and captivated by Sean s leadership and vision and is drawn to Silicon Valley much to Eduardo s consternation But with Sean s guidance comes his lavish illicit lifestyle which has potential consequences for all As the company expands to the whole country and becomes a global presence it seeks more capital and the ensuing growing pains will test friendships and lead to betrayals and litigation By the end everyone is suing to get a piece of the action We re not talking millions of dollars at stake but staggering numbers that far exceed normal comprehension Jesse Eisenberg Adventureland Zombieland is perfectly cast as Mark Zuckerberg a high energy geek running around a snowy campus in his shorts and flip flops and is quick to respond to his critics with venomous sarcasm Making us fascinated with such an unsavory character is testament to his performance Justin Timberlake is excellent as the charismatic entrepreneur Sean who is portrayed as a narcissistic lecherous Svengali and mentor to Mark Andrew Garfield lends very strong support as Eduardo Mark s roommate The film s pace is rapid and driven not a slow spot at all Its structure incorporates flashbacks and flash forwards in a masterful display of film editing The story works as a kind of techie mystery especially from the point of view of a legal deposition that frames the events of the past Every major player gets a scripted point of view Rashomon style All through the narrative you keep wondering if Mark knows more than he lets on Is he na ve or is he a schemer or both Was the betrayal of Eduardo orchestrated by Mark or was it the machinations of Sean It is never truly clear as to Mark s culpability This is success but at what price There s very little to gripe about in this film A short scene with Eduardo s psychotic girlfriend is shocking but ultimately pointless Were the filmmakers trying to show his poor judge of character Also I noticed a scene where the actors talk in the supposed cold with digital condensation coming from their mouths so how come the extras don t have any A major subplot showing Eduardo s initiation to the elite Phoenix Club never makes clear whether Mark had a hand in his acceptance With its fascinating subject matter the script begs your attention and participation Sorkin has done a marvelous job of bringing a book to life and complemented with Fincher s acumen The dialogue is stunning in its blatant display of Zuckerberg s intelligence and rebellious streak The result is a chronicle of a techie generation with not one false note and a thoroughly engrossing screenplay that has Oscar written all over it Fincher is proving himself to be a great director when given superior material and his branching out from thrillers to more mainstream fare has been remarkable as in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button One can only wonder the goodies that await movie audiences as he explores further,10
23 February 2020,An entertaining ride about the creation of the social network that changed the world,I found The social network a very engaging movie about the personal life of Mark Zuckerberg during the period in which he created Facebook The rhythm is fast the dialogues are mostly quick and there s some dry humor too All this fresh taste and the fun experience come at the expenses of telling the real story because I think that the plot has a lot of fictional elements in order to be more entertaining Clearly the main events surrounding the creation of Facebook are real but the details and the general way in which they are told is freely inspired But it s ok because its purpose isn t to be a documentary but a fun movie and it surely is the case There s also a bit of exploration about the themes of friendship loyalty and the fight for power and richness Suggested,8
18 November 2010,smart film no doubt but definitely overrated,It is a smart film no doubt but definitely overrated The director s earlier movie the fight club had generated so much hype and when I finally decided to see it I was very disappointed that the whole issue was so allegoric to the point of aversion This is definitely a better movie where you see some fine performances by the leads some whacky dialogues a non linear screenplay which adds thrill to the drama and doesn t let your attention waver till the end as you see the protagonist wait for acceptance desperately The biggest strength of the movie is that it is a true story based on a novel which lingers on the back of your mind throughout and you decide to excuse the director of some minor glitches like use of too much Harvard and geek jargon slightly undercooked characters of Mark Zuckerberg and Sean Parker One character you could easily connect with is his only friend Eduardo played by Andrew Garfield This is not a movie for everyone is supposed to be an excuse for the overrating but in that sense even Avatar or Inception were not for all This may be a smart movie but cinema is much more than being a nerd like his girl friend tells Mark at the beginning of the film Going with 3 5 stars out of 5 for David Fincher s The Social Network A movie you don t want to miss especially if you have a facebook account,7
11 August 2022,Best of the 2010s,Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher have created a highly stylised and apparently largely fictional account of Mark Zuckerberg s creation of Facebook From the halls of Harvard to the Silicon Valley the future tech billionaire scowls alienates and belittles everyone around him while furiously writing code and spitting a billion words a second The casting is fantastic with Eisenberg s personality a perfect fit for Zuckerberg and Timberlake an ironic revelation as Sean Parker Best film of the 2010s 9 10,9
19 May 2022,Eisenberg and Garfield,Outstanding lead acting by Eisenberg and Garfield and it really makes this film believable From the dialogue to the cinematography this is a great film It really doesn t have a dull moment which is great Overall 8 10,8
7 April 2020,Hard to follow at first.,GOOD INTERESTING STORY THAT IS FUN AND PRETTY EASY TO FOLLOW 1 2 Star MEMORABLE DIALOGUE 1 2 Star FEEL A PULL TO WATCH IT AGAIN 1 2 Star MUSIC OR SCORE STANDS OUT 1 2 Star NO NOTICEABLE PLOT HOLES 1 Star STORY GETS RESOLVED OR FEELS COMPLETE IN SOME WAY 1 Star I PERSONALLY LIKE OR FEEL A CONNECTION TO THIS STORY 1 2 Star MEMORABLE OR LIKABLE CHARACTERS 1 2 Star MOST THINGS ABOUT THE STORY COULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN OR ARE BELIEVABLE 1 Star STORY ISN T BORING OR REPETITIVE 0 Stars This movie is hard to follow at first but gets easier to understand as time marches on Although jumping back and forth from present and past defiantly makes the story a little harder to understand at first you eventually realize what s going on The acting is great and from what I ve read It s mostly accurate to the real story of Zuck Great but slow,6
5 May 2021,A Hideous Story about a Hideous Man,Although Jesse Eisenberg starred in numerous movies before he starred in Social Network including Zombieland when I watched this movie it was my introduction to him And I hated him I ve grown to accept that he was actually playing an extremely unlikeable character very well and I now love Eisenberg s performances particularly in The End of the Tour So I ll rate it three stars instead of one star But as I stated the real life character he portrays Mark Zuckerberg was and is increasingly repulsive so I despise this story and his glamorization As he continues to practice Stalinist tactics against high profile people such as JP Sears and right leaning commentators because they write innocuous opinions on their Facebook pages you see the true personality of the man who stole the Facebook template from two brothers who attended Harvard with him Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin s depiction of Harvard as party central is RIDICULOUSLY COMICAL The late great William S Burroughs described his experience at Harvard Everything about the place was dead I ve since spoken to several Harvard graduates who have watched this film and told me that s not the Harvard I remember Yet Sorkin insists that he collected accounts from actual Harvard grads including Natalie Portman Maybe Natalie attended the campus s special celebrity wing she doesn t strike me as one of the smartest people to phrase it politely Don t cry for Zuckerberg because he is getting increasingly scrutinized lately Don t cry for any of the people who were involved in the birth of this social media tragedy including the brothers he ripped off Postscript they received a massive settlement then converted it to insane wealth when they invested in Bitcoin and Zukerberg gave rise to his hideous cousin Jack Dorsey and his Twitter jackpot so all of these men can sleep on mattresses that are stuffed with cash as anyone who they deem unsafe can be removed entirely from all social media platforms simultaneously,3
22 April 2020,Excellent movie! Great performances by Wahlberg and Bale!,An enjoyable watch and well done is all aspects but some of the details are inaccurate to the real life events and that s what lets it down,8
6 May 2015,Not just a film about Facebook,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,8
6 January 2022,A Modern Cinematic Heavyweight,It is safe to say The Social Network is one of the greatest cinematic feats in recent memory certainly one of the best films of the 2010 s I found virtually everything in the film perfect from the performances the rich sound design and the impeccable script from Aaron Sorkin David Fincher did a tremendous job with his direction here He nailed every scene and made it very coherent throughout The narrative is simple to follow but Fincher made it dramatic and thrilling just when It needed to be As stated just the performances from all major cast members are spot on However Andrew Garfield s as Eduardo Saverin Zuckerburg s business parter is my standout favourite Garfield is such an underrated actor and brought a level of intensity that elevated the film to it s peak Eissenberg was comparatively brilliant as Mark Zuckerburg himself adding that evil genius charm and effortless precision that made him so perfect for that role The performances were made extra special by the outstanding writing of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin Sorkin s words just compelled me throughout in every scene He makes normal conversations even more engaging and his fast paced style just blew my mind Technically also this film hits the heights The sound design from Ren Kylce as well as the music from score veterans Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross make the film not only visually enthralling but also tremendously captivating from an audible standpoint It is No 1 because it s the best that s all It crushes all the competition This is what Quentin Tarantino said on The Social Network being one of the best films of the 2010 s There are other arguments for whether that s true but this is modern filmmaking at it s finest,10
3 April 2020,super quick,Very entertaining movie Mark is literally a piece of s t but in a good way because you loved watching him on screen The dialogue is super quick and witty and well written and there isn t a moment where it ever drags or anything Every scene is entertaining and adds to the story,7
18 November 2010,"A story of greed, envy and betrayal",David Fincher s latest is a wonderful film regarding the founding of that modern phenomenon we call Facebook It s about what happens to friends when ambition solidarity and loyalty turn into greed envy and betrayal Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg is an adept computer programmer After breaking up with his girlfriend he revengefully hacks into confidential records to retrieve images of female students which he uses to create a perverse online game where people can decide who is hot or not This causes a furore as singular dexterity was required to commit such an act Zuckerberg s programming prowess duly attracts the attention of other Harvard students who request his help to form a forerunner of Facebook Zuckerberg accepts and before long is sued by them and also by his best friend for intellectual property theft Much of the film takes place before a tribunal We learn that Zuckerberg s motivation is neither money or prestige It s battling against an inferiority complex by obsessing in his vocation Either that or he is what some people with power cannot avoid being hubristic It s understandable why he did not want a film to be made about him while he was alive His portrayal by Jessie Eisenberg is not a generous one cold supercilious treacherous Paradoxically he was the one to realise what humans crave most is interaction with other humans Aaron Sorkin deserves standalone recognition for his peppery script Unlikely though it may be Justin Timberlake gives a suave performance as business brain Sean Parker I didn t think I d sympathise with the plight of the well to do youngsters yet I did thanks to the credible lead performances of Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield soon to play Spider Man as Facebook co creator Eduardo Saverin Oscar Wilde once said To disagree with three fourths of the British public is one of the first requisites of sanity You could say a similar thing about the one in every 14th person who subscribes to Facebook But this film isn t about the merits of the number one social network Rather it seeks to explain how such a phenomenon changed the very people who assumed they would stay together no matter what www scottishreview net,8
13 November 2010,You don't have to be a Geek to love it!,Firstly I have to admit to being a bit of a geek and I thought this film would be just a bio of the monster that is Facebook I had no idea that the conception of lil old Facebook was so controversial I was pleasantly surprised that although I loved the Geek isms it also had a great storyline The actors are well suited to their characters and play them well without the usual over indulgence when making a movie like this I swayed between feeling sorry for the creators and envy for the groupies Altogether a great film that I would recommend,
1 April 2023,"A captivating, marvellously written story told well",The Social Network is a story told extremely well It tells the story of the early days of Facebook and the tricky double dealings which has allowed it to succeed so spectacularly The story moves along quickly but intently and this is one of the few films I would gladly label as perfectly paced Every minute of the film is absorbing and engrossing kudos to the outstanding screenplay which is intelligent and sparkling The themes of this film are also palpable and thoughtful though it probes far deeper than one commonly realises On the surface it seems as if the film explores how power and greed corrupts people and how a successful business cannot be reconciled with weak leadership Zuckerberg almost acts like a dictator in his company never relenting or compromising on any issue with Eduardo In the end he builds up a hugely successful company but at the expense of his friendship But I think this interpretation does not probe deeply enough for I think it is not power which corrupts him but his intrinsic personality Indeed Zuckerberg is portrayed as a weirdly asocial though wildly intelligent creature He backstabs his friend Eduardo and engages in deceit with the winklevoss twins not because he is a bad person with no moral compass but because he sees this morality and personal relationships as encumbering to his Independence and self assuredness He regards friends as people who merely provide company so he would not be seen as lonely while internally he convinces himself that being lonely is better for him As a consequence he does not appear to have any real emotional relationship in the film at all Eisenbergs performance captures this well Zuckerberg is definitely portrayed as the antagonist in this film but he is given moments of humanity which grounds him Consider the final scene where Zuckerberg sits alone in an office having backstabbed or pushed out all his friends and with no personal relationships to see to he appears miserable on the verge of tears It is at this end of the movie that Zuckerberg realises being alone has helped no one as he send out a friend request to his Ex girlfriend This provides a sort of redemption for Zuckerberg tying up the films themes brilliantly providing a satisfying conclusion to a captivating film,8
8 November 2010,Controversy Makes Things Attractive,I just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was alive Mark Zuckerberg has ever said so But it is unbearable they made it anyway The next question will be who on earth is Mark Zuckerberg The movie is based on the 2009s book by Ben Mezrich entitled The Accidental Billionaires The Founding of Facebook A Tale of Sex Money Genius and Betrayal Yup the movie is about people behind the birth of Facebook the most massive social network in our generation In the first half of the movie depicts how Zuckerberg fills his activities with blogging and programming And finally ends up with launching The Facebook from his Harvard dormitory room Someone told me thiz movie is all about suing Well I think she was right Substantively the second half of the movie emphasizes who is the real creator of The Facebook through some legal processes Anyone can sue anyone The question is whether or not he would win There are three important characters in thiz movie First is Jesse Eisenberg who played as Zuckerberg fully equipped with his slipper Personally I think Eisenberg sometimes talks too fast and delivers a stiff mien His performance is just enough The second is the pop star Justin Timberlake who brings a precise deep and dominant charisma into his character as Napster s founder Sean Parker The last but not the least actually it is the best performance for overall comes from our next Spider Man 2012 Andrew Garfield Garfield gives a complete emotional package for his character a friend and new enemy as well Edurado Saverin Subjectively the book Accidental Billionaires was advised by Eduardo Saverin himself without any involvement from Zuckerberg s side So the point of view is fittingly one sided The ending of the movie itself is stagnant and flat which I m kind of surprised Thiz movie comes from one of my favorite Directors David Fincher Almost half of Fincher s masterpieces have a smart and twist ending just like what we have found in Se7en 1995 The Game 1997 and one of my favorite movies of all time Fight Club 1999 But on second thought I think it s already maximized anyway considering thiz is a biography In the end if you ask me why Zuckerberg and his Facebook Why not Bill Gates or anyone else I think I can see something here One vital element that they do not have and Zuckerberg has it It is controversy Controversy makes things more attractive In these days of technology era whoever has the ability to conquer the internet it s simply being God himself Visit My Blog on JONNY S MOVEE http jonnyfendi blogspot com,8
30 August 2011,Blown Away,Title 2 Movie hours where i can definitely say they were not wasted but well spent Wow what a great film One of the few 2 hour films that i have been glued to screen for the whole of the film The quality of the picture and sound in this movie is of the utmost quality for what they were working with You can easily see how if not enough budget was given or bad decisions on cinematography how plain the film could of looked because of the nature of the film Justin finally arrived on screen after about an hour and he fitted in well Strong performance for such a renowned artist in a different area being singing He looked very much at home His qualities appear to have expanded The all round acting was top notch and from the actor Jesse playing Mark Z i was definitely impressed A lot of congratulations has to be given the script writers as it was pretty much flawless 9 10 for me and definitely would recommend to watch even more so if you use Facebook Which is pretty much everyone There are small relations that you can make to yourself and experiences which adds to a personal nature Finally it shows that determination in face of all emotional phycological physical pressures can be defeated if you just stick to what you know and never give up The world of business is ruthless,9
4 October 2022,Technical to the extreme,There was a lot a technical jargon during the movie Kind of reminded my of TV Star Trek Next Gen where the actors are required to spout technical jibberish Except what the actors in TSN were saying kind of made sense to me as an IT guy and it was a little disturbing that they were able to do it so easily Seemed like dark web stuff except that it was rather early internet and security holes were gaping at the time I gave the movie a 6 because I just didn t like the lead character too glib Maybe that s what Zucker berg it like in real like If so that s too bad Didn t care for the Sean Parker character one bit Sleazy know it all Not too many likable characters in this movie,6
11 February 2011,Why was this movie made?,It is hard to imagine what possessed anyone to think that this story would make for an entertaining film There is nothing inspiring or profound or even very interesting in the story stories like this play out in the corporate world just about every day The only reason the movie was made is because someone became obscenely wealthy at the age of 23 due to his technical savvy and Ivy League connections So what That has happened before too The main character is really unpleasant and not in a fascinating way It is depressing to know that people who behave in such a reprehensible manner can profit so greatly How many people can even relate to the characters in this film I am glad that I saw it at a friend s house and didn t pay ten dollars in a movie theater,3
5 February 2011,The Social Network: A Fitting Modern Treatment,A movie about Facebook A movie about Facebook Not even the bottom of the barrel could be so lined with mawkish garbage as this a film following the foundation of a bloody website Have they no better ideas My thoughts exactly dear reader My thoughts exactly Dumped by his girlfriend who finally recognises his apparently incurable horridness Mark Zuckerberg slanders her on the internet and creates a website for comparing the attractiveness of female Harvard students The success of this and the invitation to programme a Harvard exclusive online social network combine in the mind of the professed genius to create what would become Facebook and the eventual pair of lawsuits that would turn up along the way Like just about everyone else I was incredibly sceptical toward such an idea as a Facebook movie surely a ridiculous concept for any film The involvement of well liked screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and acclaimed director David Fincher seemed to win a great deal of sceptics over to the premise yet I remained unchanged dismissing it as uninteresting and silly A website s success warrants a film now Pfft The scene which opens the film is the one in which Zuckerberg is dumped the particular posterior based vulgarity applied by the departing girlfriend the general label hung upon him by many of the film s characters Jesse Eisenberg portrays Zuckerberg combining the flashy sarcasm of Sorkin s dialogue with his own cynical glances of self assumed intellectual superiority to create a character that we never quite get to like His sneering put downs alienate us as they do their recipients preventing all from ever really sympathising with the computer maverick And so too it should be the protagonist if even that title can rightly be applied to him portrayed as largely deserving of the general disdain held by most toward him The narrative is structured as flashbacks told through two contemporaneous depositions as the now multi billionaire Zuckerberg is sued by both the proposers of the original website idea and his former best quite probably only friend Eduardo Saverin The reason behind the former suit is evident the latter initially unknown Both Zuckerberg and Saverin appear to maintain a cordial respect for each other never quite making eye contact and each appearing sorry that this is what their friendship has come to As Saverin Andrew Garfield is perhaps the film s strongest facet his performance as the popular guy still faithful to his nerdy friend reaching a splendid climax in the scene wherein we finally learn the reason behind the lawsuit Eisenberg and Garfield play off each other very well the tension between them when the latter s character is accepted into a social club greatly desired by the former left to subtlety rather than a more visceral reaction on either part Throughout the film the comedy of the script plays a key supportive role keeping us thoroughly entertained with Sorkin s quick fire wit It s not all heavily quotable one liners however the simple story of friendship the film s thematic core By its finale as Zuckerberg sits alone in the deposition room we are left to wonder if his newly amassed multi billion dollar fortune has really changed anything Riches as his ex girlfriend might argue do not an asshole unmake An old and well explored parable it may be but it is given a fitting modern treatment here A movie about Facebook A movie about Facebook No actually A movie about friendship about jealousy and about the destructive influence of one upon the other Perhaps the explanation for the somewhat exaggerative praise heaped upon this film lies in the fact that such an initially bizarre idea has through a well written script and powerful performances become so much more,7
26 May 2022,Modern masterpiece,This might be the best movie of the last decade It is a masterpiece That makes sense since it was made by david fincher and Aaron sorkin By far the best fincher movie,9
28 February 2022,The Social Network,With an impressive cast a career defining script masterful direction and a brilliant score this film had everything in the kitchen to make an amazing film and for the most part it did This film has been hailed as one of the most important films of the century and understandingly so As stated before this film contains brilliant performances from its all star cast with characters that were written with such care from a praised screenwriter only complimented by artistic direction and topped with a score that is catchy and brilliantly meaningful to the story However despite the films brilliance in my opinion the film is flawed due to its drawn out runtime and at times confusing explanations as to what is happening Overall the film is highly recommendable but in my opinion is not as good as many hype it to be,8
12 July 2011,I expected much better.,Given the director and writer I was expecting more The opening sequence feels like Sorkin with quick witty dialogue and there are a couple of other bits like that but they are few and far between the rest of the dialogue and narration is pedestrian anyone could have written it The direction is similarly disappointing it s not bad but there is nothing special here And that really describes the film not bad but nothing special The acting is good Eisenberg Garfield and Timberlake in particular deliver excellent performances and the rest of the cast are all convincing The main problem with this film is that it is hard to care about anyone in it they all come across as arrogant egotistic and generally unpleasant Eduardo Saverin is the only likable character and he gets little screen time and spends the film being manipulated and generally messed about Zuckerberg comes across as less unpleasant than he should be if you look at the events portrayed he should be the villain instead he simply doesn t develop a personality or at least not a believable one a mixture of naivety and ruthlessness and don t go together and the film makes no attempt to explain his actions leaving the plot unsatisfying There are some nice flashes of humour some funny dialogue and some well times slapstick but not enough for this to be a comedy it isn t detailed enough for a biography it lacks the depth to be a good drama that leaves it nowhere It took three sittings to finish since I kept losing interest,
29 January 2023,How people crave social network,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,10
19 January 2011,The Social Network (2010) Starring Jessie Eisenberg Is About Business Majors In College And Their Destinies,Money won t buy you happiness but you d never know that due to screening The Social Network about billionaire before he was 30 Mark Zuckerberg founder and owner of Facebook internet website of fame This movie is a love letter to Mark and all others who worship big money as an ideal the reason to go to Harvard University the reason to drop out not clear from the movie if Mark dropped out or just took time off but did indeed get his undergrad degree no mention in the movie of his major studies if any at Harvard The Social Network 2010 starring Jesse Eisenberg is about young man named Mark Zukerberg who was a 2003 era Harvard College Massachusetts USA undergraduate computer nerd who became the main owner of Facebook and is accounted the youngest billionaire in the USA possibly in the world as of 2010 according to the printed what happened later post script words flashed onto the screen in the final scene a closeup of Zuckerberg Eisenberg at his laptop computer staring mournfully at a photo of his former girlfriend The movie won the 2010 Golden Globe Best Drama award and may win the top 2010 Academy Award prize not yet announced as of January 2011 when this review is being written So what s it all about and why all the interest It shows the world of money hungry business majors in college and shows the life of one who grabbed the golden ring and achieved big money the wet dream of all business majors and of the part of American society which believes sincerely that the business of America is business And profits and big money and all that is part of that The star of the movie Jesse Eisenberg is a young man portraying a college age undergrad at Harvard College and was probably born in the 1980 s when Ronald Reagan was USA President and put the final nails in the coffin of Franklin Roosevelt s New Deal programs and Lyndon Johnson s Great Society and War On Poverty programs USA President Bill Clinton put additional nails of importance into the same coffin when he gave the USA NAFTA and ended Welfare as we know it Reagan and Clinton and the two Bush USA Presidents announced sincerely that the party s over and it was and is What remains is what The Social Network 2010 starring Jesse Eisenberg shows a heartless social climate where the most famous and prestigious undergraduate college in the USA turns out alumni like Mark Zuckerberg and Zuckerberg s great contribution to America is Facebook and status for him as a billionaire under the age of 40 When American politicians and government renounced Socialism and all vestiges and or imitations of it starting with the election of Richard Nixon as USA President in 1968 the world of ruthless business grabs takeovers fast buck artists and kingpins like Mark Zuckerberg began Nixon rolled out the red carpet for all this and the men who followed USA Presidents from both major parties both controlled by big business always without a doubt regardless of protestations to the contrary began The Social Network 2010 shows the USA s national disease at the college level and shows at least partly what Harvard College has become not a center of culture and higher ideals or a place where Veritas truth in Latin Harvard s emblem motto has any place but place which attracts and nurtures people like Mark Zukerberg and his minions The Social Network 2010 is not great art It s not even good art Like so many Hollywood movies of past times it is sensational journalism a portrait of what s happening and a behind the scenes look at it all the newspapers of record never quite inform people about It s depressing but it s the truth Good luck to us all we ll need it July 1 2012 Columbia PA USA 17512 Additional comments written in 2012 by Tex Allen author of above review in 2012 The Social Network 2009 is a paradigm of what American culture has become Low standards the best school in America taken over by low life dreadful people and a major Hollywood movie of low quality made about it all and given the Best Picture Academy Award in Feb 2010 for Best Picture of 2009 Ugly people doing ugly things and we re all supposed to celebrate this and pay attention to a big movie made about it Damn It s like Gertrude Stein telling the world 100 years ago that Pablo Picasso was and is a good artist and his ugly art worth being ranked with Michaelangelo and Raphael The Social Network 2009 is eerily similar to Wall Street 1985 made almost a quarter of a century before Michael Douglas got the Best Actor Academy Award for Wall Stree A movie about bad guys presented in a way that many are expected cheer for the bad guy Michael Douglas played an Ivan Boesky type Jesse Eisenberg played the actual guy who goes to war with his friends and others at Harvard cheats em and wins In The Social Network 2009 the movie makers didn t even change the name It s

10 July 2022,Great biopic,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,8
26 June 2011,over hyped just like facebook but still good,So I watched 2010 s most over hyped film the social network So was it good well yes was it as awesome as advertised well no This film has quite a pedigree Oscars David Fincher Aaron Sorkin not a fan I personally think all his characters speak with the same tone just watch Sports night to get an idea of what I am talking about and universal critical praise I personally liked this movie but did not love it It is a fictionalized version of the truth a truth that is still the present for the most part I personally don t see what is so great about facebook I have an account but most of the time when I log on I see someone likes q tips thanks for sharing But it is fascinating that this genius named Mark Zuckerberg basically took being socially awkward having a chip on his shoulder and programming skills and turned all that into a company that is somehow magically valued at around 25 billion dollars another thing that I just don t understand Zuckerberg apparently did all this while he sacrificed friendship and screwed over a couple of uber twins to become the king nerd This film does give us some sense of the basic story of how someone became the world s youngest billionaire It is also interesting well acted and has broad appeal However just like facebook itself I think it is overvalued over hyped and may very well be more of a fad than a classic if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http raouldukeatthemovies blogspot com,7
19 February 2011,Great dialogue film!,I went to see this in Mexico the last day of showing which meant that i already knew lots of opinions and praises this film is getting Taking that into account i really liked The social network The story is not anything groundbreaking and it being themed with facebook does not count as anything new but a new and modern way to tell this kind of story which made me feel it like a win for this film for how it was presented The acting was great to say the least Jesse Eisenberg was more than good for me and i liked his annoying role Andrew Garfield was amazing and not only because of his looks but because he really does a splendid job and it wouldn t be the first time I did like Justin Timberlake but i found nothing major there And it was funny to see the Disney channel Asian girl on the film considering i had no idea she was on it The pacing is good but what really keeps the film going is the quirky and intelligent dialogue If there is something this film deserves is the adapted screenplay I was emerged from the dialogue in the film and quite liked it It was obvious how the story was turning out but how it was presented with the lawsuits and real life experiences combined that made really glad to watch this film Congratulations Fincher good job again,8
21 November 2010,Great! Don't even have to be a Facebook fan to like it.,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,10

12 November 2015,"Strikingly, Electrically Modern- Fincher's Best",I love David Fincher I love his style his cinematic poise and above all what he represents He is the walking talking counterpoint to anyone who says film was better back in the day He uses modern sensibilities and techniques to tell modern stories Okay Author interruption over I m not here to talk about what Fincher represents I m here to talk about what I believe to be the crowning film in his multi jeweled golden crown This film The Social Network is about one of the defining men of the twenty first century Mark Zuckerberg It is not a straight historical retelling of which I am mercifully glad If the so called historical purists had their way this film would a snore There are some people whose factual life stories make for good film the subject of my last review General George S Patton is one of them Mark Zuckerberg is not Other than the fact that he founded a multi billion dollar company his life would hardly make for a better story than would mine Granted that is a big other but still he does not have grand tales of drama and adventure This is not helped by the fact that he is at the time of this piece s writing Nov 11 2015 Veterans Day only 31 None of this is a knock on the man who I believe to be the living breathing representation of why despite it s many many faults I love the country that I live in He is in fact an idol of mine But his life still would not make an interesting movie told straight up That s where Fincher comes in Okay not just Fincher the film s writer one Aaron Sorkin deserves a lot of the credit too As does Jesse Eisenburg the actor who plays Zuck despite looking nothing like the billionaire he is convincing and emotive and a strong conduit if he was bad this film would not work But he is and it does As a self proclaimed expert on titles I can say that this film has a good one Consider that they could have easily just named it Zuck or Zuckerberg or Mark Zuckerberg or Facebook or another one of the standard biopic titles and did not something that fits the fact that this film is decidedly not a straight biopic as I have repeatedly mentioned But it didn t just avoid being standard it was great again like the movie The title of the book that this film was based on was The Accidental Billionaires I m not going to pretend that s not a good a title it is It shows how success just rushed up on these guys like a rushing tsunami leaving them to deal with the consequences But the film is titled better tackling a larger scope I can t go two feet or two seconds nowadays without hearing the words Social Network or Social Media or something of that sort But Facebook isn t just a social network It is The Social Network Everyone who came after Zuck has been living in his shadow and perhaps they always will He pushed the world onward like few others of the past few decades and the title reflects that Many people well some this movie does have a ninety six percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes and will be on many best of the decade lists have a problem with what they consider to be simple characterization of Zuckerberg I would not quite say that this is a nothing complaint but I do think that it was expanded greatly by people just seeing what they want to see Zuckerberg has built with his hands and mouse one of the largest and most successful startups ever I think he has a right to be a little defensive and aggressive I know I would be No the real Zuckerberg is probably not like this And if you re in the wrong mood it could get a bit on one s nerves But I think this is a primary case of people not checking their personal moralities and beliefs at the door and embracing the art as you should every time you re watching a good movie Remember this point I will bring it up again when I review Amelie Anyway the soundtrack is subtle the visual style captures the tone and subject matter of the film perfectly and the script is tight enough The dialogue is sharp and on point because of course it is it s a Sorkin film There are a lot of blues in the film making it look visually striking But even if you don t prefer style over substance like I do don t worry There is enough in the film for you too it has a certain way of blowing you away while keeping your feet on the ground The narrative arc for this film is incredible You feel every high and every low and at the end you are right there with Zuckerberg wondering how it has all come to this It is an introspective and contemplative film one that evokes on an artistic level a philosophical level and an entertainment level Inception may be my favorite film of this decade but if there is one that I believe to be indicative of everything worthwhile from it this movie would be right up there in consideration Go see it if you haven t P S The biggest surprise for me when watching this was how good JT was He is a good actor when cast properly P P S In case you re wondering yes I do believe this film was screwed out of Best Picture because Oscar voters are a bunch of old white men who probably have no clue what a face book is,10
22 March 2020,Believing Is Seeing!,The Social Network you know that Mark Zuckerberg is a billionaire but you don t know how so this gets u back to the beginning i don t find it as a inspirational movie but i find it as a imaginative movie well obviously no one is a billionaire with out being a creative person so this shows our path of life we still need to go for something even if it means nothing for others i can t deny that Jesse Eisenberg is a copy of Mark he always reminds me of Mark when i see him so no doubt he is the man of the role What i liked about it Is the pacing and a truly organized movie with the details for us you won t be lost with it so the directing and editing is a well done i still imagine if things didn t went this way Would this guy still be a billionaire This is unanswerable question i understand he was creative but What would the other path would lead if it wasn t this way i find biographical movies interesting so we need to take a look at this section because they always end up with a message for you highly recommended if you want to experience others 8 10,8
3 October 2010,Not Oscar-worthy,Superb direction Stellar script Bravura performance by Jesse Eisenberg And it all adds up to So what The Social Network is less than the sum of its parts A lot of flash substance not so much Fincher knows how to tell a story He knows how to please a crowd But his films lack the gravitas and emotional resonance that mark the very best American films the ones worthy of Hollywood s highest accolades I liked this movie a lot I expect it will get one of the 10 Best Picture nominations But there are other films this year far more deserving of the Best Picture statuette and I hope the Academy has the good sense to choose one of those films over The Social Network,

23 February 2020,Fascinating even if it is only partly factual,The Social Network is now ten years old It s already ancient history in tech years Anyway it was enjoyable I watched it via Comcast On Demand and I could not fast forward thru the endless repetitive commercials which became oppressive It is an interesting movie I haven t paid that much attention to Zuckerberg or really how Facebook was created So I found it fascinating I m not surprised I suppose that Zuckerberg is portrayed as a monster at least in some ways It comes with the territory I knew a man who was a developer during the dot com boom and there s a lot of craziness going on here that I recognized that I lived through in a way Those were strange times They were strange people It was weird and bizarre There will likely never be anything quite like that again And the whole connection with Sean Parker Napster was news to me Like I said strange times Also it was funny the actor playing Parker looked oddly familiar Hah It is of all people Jusin Timberlake Who is quite good So is Andrew Garfield Eisenberg is just wonderful and I think did a great job in the role The acting is fantastic It s an ensemble cast that shines The music is wonderful I have nothing bad to say about the movie It was worth watching even while being tortured by commercials every ten or fifteen minutes Here is it ten years after the movie was made and Facebook well it has over 1 5 billion members,

8 November 2010,Incredibly skillful and unique masterpiece,I can really only talk in superlatives about what this crew of fine people managed to accomplish here The key is not even in the sophistication of the separate parts it s how everything comes together into coherence Aaron Sorkin truly outdid himself with this script I tend to dislike Snappy dialog but snappy here emerges from meaningless junk that can be applied to any crap to make it somewhat watchable creating a standalone art form The absolutely genuine characters each of them truly interesting and entertaining are merely played to perfection by around everyone of the absolutely felicitous cast Finchers unique and familiar skills place this movie on Fight Club territory equaling the artistic values of the classic but support the movie in a more subtle and refined way underlined by Trent Reznors discreet musical universe and the famous dark cinematographic style of Jeff Cronenweth 7even FC which is so welcome considering other directors might have approached the theme as some sunshiny college movie I m not a big facebook user but the fact that it s about one of the surprisingly most relevant and trendy mediums these days something that touches most peoples lives in one or the other way the fact that you can like REALLY personally relate to the whole thing gives a very unique touch something I never experienced to this degree in a movie before I guess the timing for picking the subject was just about perfect but who would have thought that someone can pull a serious artful movie out of a story about the founder of a website so to say I have absolutely nothing bad to say here all the fantastic artwork coming together makes The Social Network a high quality genuine masterpiece that is really hard to forget Must see for about everyone,10
3 April 2021,"David Fincher, a master of crafting movies.",The story of Mark Zuckerberg and how facebook was created could easily been a very boring film since basically it s about arrogant nerds dreaming of making something with their coding capabilities David Fincher manage to make it both an suspenseful and fun ride at the same time While also very accurate to the truth I believe he usually studies the subject for his creation very thoroughly just watch Zodiac for example which could almost be a semi documentary Facebook showed the world what social media could be and laid the foundation of what social media is today a extremely huge part of our society It s an interesting story of our modern society and this is a very well made film about it,9
13 May 2021,Social Network,I really like this movie but the reason I like it purely because of Aaron Sorkin s dialog and Jesse Eisenberg s delivery of that dialog The rest of the movie just serves as a vehicle for that,8
29 January 2011,Save yourselves!!,You know a movie is bad when you start checking the time and wondering exactly how much longer it will last In case you re wondering it s two hours And if you watch this movie it will be two hours of your life that you won t get back There are very few likable characters in this film Actually I m trying hard to think of any Zuckerberg comes across as an arrogant know it all who really did steal the idea for Facebook from others Well they came up with a small idea and he took it and made it a bigger one but it wasn t his to begin with Eduard Saverin is made to seem like a nice guy who got shafted but then he wasn t as smart as he thought he was The Winklevoss twins looked silly although they were shafted by Zuckerberg Sean Parker looks like an opportunist who saw a good thing and hitched a ride Trouble is we don t really care about any of them There s really not much else to say If it wins the Oscar for Best Picture that would be a travesty,4
16 July 2021,Wooooo,It s really great they play well and play roles I m an engineer and I really liked this movie,10
10 October 2010,"You are not an a**h**e, but you are trying so hard to be one..",I am an active Facebook user has got many friends do spend enough time on checking updates photos video s from my friends I was curious to watch this movie after reading few good review s about it Movie run time is some 2 hours some odd minutes I didn t realize when it finished as it was so engrossing engaging Jesse who played Mark Zuckerberg acted so well that I wouldn t wish to see anyone else to play that character See him the way he reacts to Attorney s questions in a witty though sarcastic way Andrew Garfield who played Eduardo Saverin is another Gem he pulled the role so well you would hate him many time being so self centered Justin Timberlake gives justice to his role of Sean Parker as a founder of the Napster Armie Hammer was effective too There are many rumors about FB not sure how much true was about it in movie but surely got the picture what it takes to be a Punk Genius Billionaire,9
26 July 2011,Insanely good. Way better than the actually Facebook online.,I actually wrote this review right after I saw the movie in theaters Maybe like the second or third day it was out I never knew that a movie about Facebook could be so amazing I had low expectations and they were in fact superseded times a hundred Since this review I have seen the movie at least one more time in theaters and about four or five times on DVD with different people or by myself Here is the review Music Besides film and sports my favorite thing ever is music Although I do not enjoy all types of music I do try to respect them Although nowadays it s hard to Music is constantly changing with the people Unknown to me two musical composers one from England Atticus Ross and another America Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails teamed up to create The Social Network s soundtrack its kind of a post industrial experimental ambient sound I must say that it s amazing I downloaded it the night I came back from seeing Social Network It s hard to find such a solid soundtrack these days Always using the mainstream music That was nice to hear Also the whole story of The Social Network is so intriguing and awe spelling How Facebook came to be is such an interesting process and story told It s also one that only Mark Zuckerberg can understand played by Jesse Eisenberg whom is great per usual He really knows how to play that nerd well The writing is so smart quick and witty too The screenplay was done by Aaron Sorkin he also did the popular television show entitled The West Wing I m definitely going to have to see this movie several more times to not even come close to comprehending it all The general gist is there but I feel like something will always be missing The whole idea of the internet leading to all this social networking is changing our world as we know it and how we live hopefully its for the better and not worse As a marketing major it was also interesting to see this movie from that perspective Its making our advertising much more integrated in the social experience We also got to see the new Spiderman in this movie Andrew Garfield I thought him and the majority of the cast did a job well done Everything in this movie was superb I can t wait to see it again Insanely good Way better than the actually Facebook online The Nuz Journal 9 10 Stars,9
18 May 2022,"Score by Trent Reznor, directed by David Finchner",Anything with NIN I m there He s worked with Finchner on Seven and Fight Club I believe Jessie Kills it as Mark Zuckerberg Supposedly he s not like that in real life Also the actor who played Eduardo is brilliant at this roll All In all a good movie about Harvard the level of genius it represents As for social media I m not too big on it lol enjoy,8
19 May 2013,This is a TV movie,I suppose it satisfies the American s need to feel smug and superior but I wonder how many viewers from elsewhere are similarly impressed This isn t because many of us either went to or have associations to universities older and more prestigious than Harvard it s because we don t like the swagger I imagine those who say they don t like the movie are accused of not understanding it but this isn t true There isn t much to be confused about the plot isn t complex the issues involved in the litigations aren t difficult to understand In fact the contrary is true the dialogue is easy to follow when the protagonist isn t trying to impress by speaking too quickly That s a failing of the film by the way I would like to think modern audiences perhaps particularly those outside the USA aren t impressed by the such an obvious ploy Gosh isn t he clever he speaks SO quickly Of course it might be said the real Mark Z speaks quickly this might be true but he isn t in a film So what are we left with A movie with all the failings of trying to impress too much Acting which is adequate casting which is the same a plot which unwinds almost tediously and dialogue which would be the highlight of the film if it weren t spoken so quickly It s a very underwhelming experience,3
1 October 2010,"An absorbing, intelligent and timely pop culture technology portrait of the last decade",The Social Network Directed by David Fincher Written by Aaron Sorkin Based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich Released September 2010 Chicago Viewed October 1 2010 Excellent I liked this almost masterpiece of a film very much Director David Fincher keeps things moving along at a lively pace and shows a refreshingly original style and mastery of how to best tell the story of the film Due to the subject matter this is a case where the product is much more famous than it s creators Based on the startup of facebook com by Harvard student Mark Zuckerburg and friend fellow student beginning in 2003 on the campus of Harvard University After telling the beginning genesis of the facebook as it was known at Harvard at the time the film then tells the remainder of it s story in flashback during a double law suit deposition by four Harvard students alleging Zuckerburg stole the idea of facebook from them Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin delivers an absorbing and intelligent screenplay with biting humor and wit The film itself is part social commentary with some thought provoking statements about the popular influence of social websites and the good and bad of the current Internet information age we live in Accessing too much information too quickly easily and the ability to share it freely with the whole world presents some problems Without maturity wisdom good judgment and reasoning harm can be easily done intentionally or unintentionally Things can be taken out of context and facts distorted easier than ever before The film looks and feels very authentic I was impressed by the focused direction and the intelligent witty and humorous writing style The film begins with a good bang The opening scene is set in a college bar It s 2003 Mark Zuckerberg and a female friend are having a passionate discussion about many different topics Zuckerberg is presented as riding a thin line between highly motivated and obsessed with ideas He s a very intelligent young man and his brain is jam packed with many ideas swirling around at the same time His female friend comments that conversing with him is like being on a stairmaster It s simply too tiring and also a little confusing Fincher knows exactly the right pace and rhythm and exactly how to set up and execute each individual scene while getting some excellent all around acting performances out of his mostly young cast The first two things I noticed and was impressed by early into the film were Jesse Eisenburg s exceptional acting performance as facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg and the screenplay The excellent direction of Fincher then becomes apparent Jesse Eisenburg nails his role portraying facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg convincingly as a highly intelligent introverted slightly immature social inept and nerdy 19 year old Harvard student who entered Harvard with an impressive perfect 1600 score on his SAT He does a great if unusual job at defending himself against his accusers during the deposition Also Justin Timberlake gives a convincing supporting role performance as slightly paranoid but passionate and driven Napster founder Sean Parker and third startup partner of facebook The Social Network is definitely one of the most timely intelligent and engaging films to come along in a while,10
6 October 2018,Compelling drama,The performances were amazing I feel like many can relate being facebook users I don t know how close this is to the real events but definitely felt engaged the whole time JT does a great job I have to say The soundtrack is really cool too,8
1 October 2010,"Jason Gregg Likes ""The Social Network""",I know it is pretentious of me to place my name in the title of my review But after leaving David Fincher s film The Social Network I could only feel arrogant and overly confident The movie has a strong young cast of characters who play their roles with enormous confidence that radiates off of the screen Jesse Eisenberg plays Mark Zuckerberg the co founder of Facebook with such unwarranted cockiness I wanted to punch him in his smug little face in the first 10 minutes The film brings us closer to see more than the hyper intelligent boy genius and by the end I wanted to add him as a friend on Facebook or at least like him David Fincher the director of Fight Club Seven and his screenwriter Aaron Sorkin screenwriter for The West Wing Charlie Wilson s War based the movie on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich Facebook and the actual Mark Zuckerberg wanted nothing to do with the film The story begins in 2003 at a bar where Mark is being dumped by his girlfriend Erica Albright played by Rooney Mara This one opening scene sets the over analytical persona of Mark for the entire film Is he arrogant A bit Is he too smart for his own good Definitely Does he understand that his intelligence can make others feel inferior Only after he sees what he has done does he feel any type of remorse or regret After being dumped a hurt Mark goes back to his dorm has a few drinks and starts blogging about how much he despises his new ex girlfriend All in one night he develops a Web site where Harvard classmates can rate the attractiveness of other students and the site crashes Harvard s computer network Not bad for a night s work Through his actions Mark garners the attention of a set of twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss both played by Armie Hammer who are starting their own Web site similar to MySpace and Friendster They hire Mark to help develop the site and grow it into something that they could never do on their own And here s where the trouble begins Mark begins to play both sides of the field to borrow startup money from his best friend Eduardo Saverin played by Andrew Garfield and at the same time he takes the Winklevoss initial idea to develop his own site Since Mark Zuckerberg the actual guy and Facebook have distanced themselves from the film it has intrigued many people to want to know more That is going to be the driving force behind the box office sales To better illustrate this point there is a scene in the film where Zuckerberg and Eduardo meet with the founder of Napster Sean Parker played by Justin Timberlake Added sidebar I think it is great that Fincher had someone from the music industry play the guy who was responsible for ripping off that same industry In this scene the trio is discussing how to market Facebook Eduardo wants to get advertisers on board ASAP while Mark and Sean wants to let Facebook grow before they start trying to make money off the deal Let the users determine the growth of the product Fincher and Sorkin did the exact same thing with the promotion of this film If Facebook said yes to the film then it would look like a Pro Facebook campaign Start a conflict let people think that this is Facebook s dirty little secret on how it all started and the rest will take care of itself About halfway through you start realizing that this film is no longer about Facebook in fact it could be a story about any product or service on the market today Fincher doesn t spend much time focusing on the actual Web site He focuses on Mark s two legal depositions that are happening simultaneously and the human and financial wreckage caused by his actions This film is simply about greed and the want for more Not necessarily more money that wasn t Zuckerberg s intention when he started his site He wanted to fit in with the rest of us He couldn t find an opening to the exclusive clubs on Harvard s prestigious campus so he stared his own club Should you see this movie Yes But not because you have a Facebook profile that you like to update every hour This film is not about Facebook This is a captivating lesson in human relationships It is a window to the deep dark soul of capitalism It s about living with past regrets,8
1 October 2010,News Feed: The Social Network—Like,See it Now My Critical Perspective A My Personal Perspective B Is the film a one hundred percent factual history about the creation of Facebook No it isn t but that s not the point The film is based on the book The Accidental Billionaires written about how Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook and the controversies surrounding its creation The basic plot of the film is about the proceedings that took place when Mark Zuckerberg was sued on two different fronts by his best friend and co founder Eduardo Saverin and by the Winklevoss twins who thought he stole the Facebook idea from them The story is told through a number of flashbacks revealing Mark Zuckerberg s programming background and how came up with the idea and developed over time what we all know as Facebook The Good David Fincher is an amazing director and has not directed a bad movie yet The Social Network is very different from his other ventures that include both Fight Club and Zodiac However the progression of his directing career is very visible in The Social Network which is by far his best directed film Fincher always films his movies with a certain contrast of light and shadows in order to create the atmosphere that he wants his audience to feel He does this once again in The Social Network by filming it in a shadowy light which slowly lightens up by the end All of the actors in the film do an excellent job as well especially Jesse Eisenberg Zombieland Adventureland Andrew Garfield the new Spiderman Armie Hammer and Justin Timberlake Eisenberg has grown a lot throughout his different roles and has his best performance in this film with his portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg that may even lead him towards an Oscar nomination this year He creates an egotistical asshole persona with perfection and articulates his sentences so well he can insult someone without them even knowing what hit them Andrew Garfield shows the audience through his character Eduardo Saverin Mark s best friend that he is a worthy Hollywood actor and may surprise us in the Spiderman reboot Armie Hammer plays the Winklevoss twins who are shot extremely well by Fincher differentiating them enough to create their own two separate characters Justin Timberlake also makes an appearance and has a very good performance with his character Sean Parker Despite the acting and directing the thing that stands out the most in this film is the time and effort Aaron Sorkin put into adapting the screenplay from the book The Accidental Billionaires The story and dialogues are so well put together and rattled off so fast and naturally by each of the actors that the film feels very real There are also a plethora of one liners and monologues that almost literally punch the character in the face whom they are directed towards along with the audience itself The Bad The film creates a very bad image for women other than Rooney Mara s character Erika Albright and Rashida Jones s character Marylin Delpy All of the other women in the film are portrayed as drunk greedy sluts This may be very offensive to some people and may be a reason not to see the film if you feel very strongly about it Also there are minor discontinuities throughout the film that may have been able to be a little clearer and a couple short scenes that don t seem necessary to the overall storyline of the film Final Thought There s a difference between making a movie and creating a movie when you make a movie you just go through the motions of preproduction production and post production however when you create a movie this is taken to a whole other level David Fincher takes it to a whole other level by creating the atmosphere and then lets loose Who knew that a film about Facebook could grasp and keep your undivided attention and send you on a thrilling roller coaster ride with wellcrafted dialogue and a very relevant soundtrack Go See it Now and see what all of the hype is about,9
5 October 2010,10% inspiration and 90% perspiration,I ve been hearing the phrase It s only a movie probably before I even began watching movies When I was younger it was to make sure a film didn t scare the sh t out of me before going to bed Now more so in reference to fact checking especially if the film is based off a true story The Social Network is one of those films where I had to tell myself its only a movie before going in having some prior knowledge of the true events In knowing this The Social Network being based on a true events embellishes and manufactures certain aspects of the plot and changes character traits motivations in order to achieve the best cinematic experience possible It s a good study on how a film can take a basic somewhat mundane story and tweak it until it s a perfectly structured neat little package The movie partially based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich is supposedly itself part fabrication because Mezrich never interviewed the film s protagonist and founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg as well as most of the book being debunked by other Facebook insiders The film s Zuckerberg played by Jesse Eisenberg is a brilliant but angry egotistical arrogant asshole who comes off as knowing he would be a billionaire even before writing the first line of code for Facebook Anyone who knows the real Mark Zuckerberg says he s actually a nice guy who rarely gets angry David Kirkpatrick author of The Facebook Effect said Zuckerberg is one of the least angry people I ve ever met This might be the most glaring disparity between the film s story and the actual one And although it is an obvious Hollywoodizing device using it was a wise choice considering how well this movie performs under the skewed yet perfectly executed screenplay Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin never met with Mark Zuckerberg either purposefully He knew transforming him into a cruel and unrelentingly ambitious prick was the unapologetic direction needed to fuel the plot Sorkin said I don t want my fidelity to be to the truth I want it to be to storytelling And even in the script he admits every creation myths need a devil So with that in mind Sorkin s Zuckerberg became an ambivalent anti hero an emotionless machine only driven by success Machine being the operative word and most obvious and clich parallel Sorkin and director David Fincher make it clear that Zuckerberg is so talented on his machine because he thinks and acts like one There were a couple of times where I couldn t help but compare Zuckerberg to Bill Gates not only because there is a direct reference to him in the film but if you ve seen The Pirates of Silicon Valley there are more than a couple similarities between the two especially in their cutthroat methods in empire building But I suppose this is true for any genius inventor who knows when it s there time to strike the iron Thomas Edison one of the most cutthroat inventors of them all said it best Success is 10 inspiration and 90 perspiration The real Zuckerberg might have done it cleaner than the rest but it doesn t mean he can escape being dragged through the dirt for it,8
15 June 2021,Fascinating,A very fascinating and somewhat engaging true story Slow at points but levelled out by captivating performances,7
13 April 2020,Full of wit and humor.,The high density narrative rhythm the wonderful music and editing and the exquisite dialogue coupled with the unexpectedly brilliant performances of several young stars The social network is full of wit and humor,7
27 March 2018,One of the best movies of the last 20 years,I love this movie so much I m a massive David fincher fan And this movie only makes me love him more The way he dramatically and gracefully shows the story of Facebook from beginning to present is more than brilliant I don t think anyone else could have made this story into a film Amazing performances Jessie eisenberg was sublime I watched this movie so many times and I highly recommend anyone doing the same You don t have to be interested in social media or technology to enjoy this film It is so much more than that,9
11 October 2013,It this a Horror..,Well I consider this movie is a fine piece of modern film making This In a way they represent the worst of the previous generations The actors did an amazing job they should all be recognized for their work in this movie The Roman Emperors or Wall Street The Profit is the name of the game and the ideas come out of boredom of longings to get laid Love and friendship loyalty or honor as good manners Jesse Eisenberg is creatively perfect as the humanoid that started it all or did he Justin Timberlake keeps surprising me I read one article about this at Bonzipal Social Network It was explaining in details and I will post more but you can Google Bonzipal for now,4
3 January 2020,Historical movie,This movie is based on true story which is Facebook As you know that company has made a history in IT era You can know a history simply that you already may know If you are curious and don t really know about how Facebook was established you should watch it,9
5 March 2014,A Great Movie but even better screenplay,The real star of this film is the extraordinary screenplay written by Aaron Sorkin The characters he creates here are dark flawed and the epitome of the worst of the 2000s culture that the target audience of the film sprang from Fincher does a fabulous job of interpreting this and bringing it to life on the screen His visual of the script is bold and vibrant exactly what was called for by the script The problem with this film is that the performances aren t really that spectacular They are good enough to carry the film but that s the best I can say for them Armie Hammer as the Winklevoss twins was probably the weakest link of the bunch He hammed it up big time and turned them into caricatures I still haven t figured out why Jesse Eisenberg s performance was so applauded The performance at times was two dimensional All in all this is a great film Fincher has done better with The Curious Case of Benjamin Buttons but this was arguably one of the better films of the years,7
14 October 2010,A movie about origins of facebook,The Social Network is a well made movie about the origins of facebook The movie begins with Mark Zuckerberg to be creator of facebook having dinner with his girlfriend and this opening scene perfectly introduces Mark s character and sets the tone of the movie He is an intelligent kid who is not socially adept You can tell this by the way he talks to his girlfriend and what he does after the dinner He goes to his dorm and writes bad things about his girlfriend on the web and insults her publicly He also breaks into the school s database server steals people s pictures from the directory and sets them up on the web in doubles as part of a competition to pick who is the hotter girl The Social Network shows how someone while creating a brilliant tool that minimizes the distance between people is creating a distance between him and the people around him That is ironic It also makes you question if morals and smart business decisions should always be in agreement Because the decisions he makes are actually earning him benefits as an entrepreneur but creating conflicts with the others I found myself wanting to side with him because he is a clever guy but he also has a way of looking down on people in a condescending way or pretending as if they don t exist The movie also makes you think the delicate connection between an idea as inception and its execution You may have an idea but if you don t have the ability to execute the idea and turn it into a reality you will be dependent on someone else The executing ability could be better than just having the idea I think this is a movie that anyone can appreciate and will find its subject matter interesting After all Facebook has revolutionized how people socialize today,8
10 August 2019,Masterpiece.,10 10 Beautifully acted directed Superb soundtrack Believe it or not but this movie beaten Fight Club for me I love how Fincher makes movie about Facebook and he makes it so damn interesting This movie alone makes Fincher 2nd favourite director After Stanley Kubrick Please if you like good movies this is movie for you Everything in this movie is Amazing Watch it,10
21 October 2014,Out of Connection: The Social Network's Subtle Commentary on 21st Century Society,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,10

17 June 2011,How a massive site was born,This revolves around the inception of current social networking giant Facebook com along with a bitter feud between those who were closely related to its creation In the ancient days people settled their differences in a battle of strength nowadays it requires shrewd brain power and a laptop to one up your opponent Swords are replaced by keyboards brave words are replaced by written law The modern age which includes phenomenons such as social networking on the internet on a computer powered by electricity made the world a little smaller but also more interconnected and complex than it has ever seen in its history One of the most iconic rises to the top from competition was Pumping Iron It focused on bodybuilding but audiences learned the general rule of thumb for anyone getting ahead is you re going to either purposely or inadvertently step on others That goes for someone taking ideas to another giving out help Mother Teresa had enemies as does a CEO Someone out there is going to have their feelings hurt or rights violated when someone else wants to advance Although if there s a line where does it get crossed At the expense of your friends and business partners over your own ambitions The Social Network centers around a remediating legal case in progress between different parties who feel they had their rights violated This switches from past to present with some stylized filmmaking mechanics to make one think more is going on than meets the eye The backdrop is basically your average college kids think National Lampoon minus the comedy doing what they do between classes There is no doubt a minor story to had though the filmmakers slipped in some tabloid scandal to pad the rest and it didn t require two hours to tell it insignificant ties to it or extremely loud music that drowns out conversations to sell it This would have been better suited as a documentary as it would cut away the flash and trivial fat Conversations range from incoherently fast to frequently drawn out Literally word for word is expressed without pulling away or cutting back on whether it s significant This isn t rewarding like a A Beautiful Mind where you got a balanced understanding of how a unique process works and an intimate knowledge of the unconventional person behind it without wanting to wring their neck Facebook mogul Mark Zuckerberg is like Spock from Star Trek or Chloe from 24 who looks at situations as logical as opposed to emotional Zuckerberg doesn t see companionship like you or I but sometimes wants to fit in despite mostly being a jerk without necessarily doing it on purpose Possibly his only true friend and co founder Eduardo Saverin gets the short end of the stick as he s a nice guy in a dog eat dog world Napster renegade Sean Parker is a leech that sucks onto opportunity without actually bringing in technical skill but instead charisma and connections The three who originally brought their social network idea to Zuckerberg Divya Narendra and Winklevoss twins range from reserved outspoken to confrontational though each equally want what is deserved by bringing lawyers to the table as a last resort to negotiate For all parties it turns into he said this he said that bickering When millions of dollars are on the line maybe you would too though that shared connection doesn t make this any more intriguing or even noteworthy to watch with all the minute nit picking and overdramatization The Social Network like the film Flash of Genius about Ford using windshield wipers without permission brings a deal gone sour to the public s attention It s hard to say if this is 100 accurate as it s based on the book The Accidental Billionaire from the perspective of Eduardo Saverin the co founder who got the short end of the stick If all parties were involved this would have been better suited towards a sanctioned biography as it s still interesting that these sexed up drinks down college guys started out young and made something out of themselves by sheer luck and risk The film tries to tie it all together by hinting that a socially awkward guy used the only skill set he had to create a massive social network to win over the girl Of course he doesn t care about those billions of dollars but the love of the game writing code Though getting to that point and trying to sympathize after dragging through the nitty gritty was an exercise in ad nauseam Also submitted on Cinema Freaks http docuniverse blogspot com,5
17 July 2023,The Facebook's story,It was called The Facebook In 2003 Harvard undergrad and computer genius Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg begins work on a new concept that eventually turns into the global social network known as Facebook Six years later he is one of the youngest billionaires ever but Zuckerberg finds that his unprecedented success leads to both personal and legal complications when he ends up on the receiving end of two lawsuits one involving his former friend Andrew Garfield The movie that s based on the book The Accidental Billionaires doesn t only explore all the success Mark faced but also all his struggles during his journey Although it s mainly just dialogue occuring throughout the movie it does keep the audience engaged Great performances from the whole cast but especially from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield as Eisenberg does a terrific job delivering the lines while Garfield handles the emotional part pretty well The script is amazingly written and the characters are also well rounded however you struggle to feel any connection with any of them as they all have major and minor flaws especially Zuckerberg as he is described as an unethical and arrogant outcast Although the movie is beautifully written with great performances from the whole cast it is a bit forgettable but it is informative and entertaining if you want know about Facebook s history Score 7 5 10,7

13 March 2011,Possibly the least entertained and gripped I have ever been by any film,After the generally fantastic media and critical reception of this film along with the ridiculous number of award nominations it received seemingly 1 nomination for every dollar the film cost to make I was frankly stunned and appalled at how mind numbingly dull this film is The script alone would make far less interesting reading than a phone book or indeed a book filled with random numbers and letters The cinematography was relentlessly uninspired the score cheap and cheerful To my ears as well the mixing seemed to be off the dialog sometimes too fast and quiet drowned out by the ambient noise particularly the first scene Upon doing some research it seems that large swathes of the film are wildly inaccurate which in itself is not a bad sign for a film After all based on true events is a slogan that often precedes a moderately entertaining picture albeit one that recognizes that the true events aren t quite up to standard and need spicing up with lots of guns explosions and cleavage In The Social Network there is none of this the spicing up entails the twisting of the story to make Zuckerberg look as much like some Aspergers suffering Nazi Savant as is possible and a pure fantasy representation of the context of the story namely life for an Undergraduate at Harvard University through uninspired American Pie standard stereotypes In short the remake of this film cannot come quickly enough and next time around they should follow in the tradition of a long line of films which proclaim themselves to be based on fact sort of probably possibly maybe a little bit This time perhaps if when the servers crash this could lead to a nuclear meltdown in the submarine s reactor did I mention it should be set upon a submarine where several of the crew die heroically attempting to affect repairs then Zuckerberg and Saverin could land on the shores of South America and go on a motorcycle road trip of personal and political discovery seducing some South American super models on the way Then on his way to a meeting to secure investment Saverin could get his hand caught in the closing doors of the lift and having faced 10 minutes of the excruciating aural torture that is lift music been forced to sever his own hand through repeatedly stabbing himself in the wrist with a sharp pencil Meanwhile Zuckerberg could be possessed by an evil spirit and repeatedly stab himself in the crotch until a priest with a tendency to see suicide as the only way to solve the problem in hand can show up and save the day Finally Zuckerberg and Saverin waltz out of the front door of their London club with a bank account numbering in the billions and it all looks rosy until Zuckerberg is shot by his girlfriend s love sick ex and Saverin suddenly discovers that some African Dictator has severed all his limbs and sewn them on back to front promptly dropping dead In short what I am saying is this film is rubbish it is about as deserving of any Award other than sleep aid of the year as I am deserving of the presidency The disappointing thing is this isn t even one of those bad films that is so bad it becomes entertaining although not for the reasons envisaged by the producers This is a terrible work of fiction professing to be truth with average acting a weak score and a script that is less inspired than a pile of sand If you have not seen this then don t bother only watch this in 30 years time when the film industry has collapsed due to file sharing and you are absolutely sick of watching Inception over and over again,2
27 February 2011,Socially Awesome,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,9

23 June 2020,"Treason, ambition, Internet",It is never an easy task to adapt a true story let alone such a recent and contemporary biography However David Fincher has succeeded He has done it in the best possible way The social network tells us how the famous Mark Zuckerberg founded the popular social network Facebook Fincher tells us a story of power ambition and above all treason All through a script that will jump between different times each filling the holes that are planted Although clearly a good script is not enough if there is not a good director behind and luckily this film finds David Fincher at its highest point We are probably facing one of his best works so far Although we must not neglect the great performance provided by Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg possibly the best one he has performed to date One of the most fluid and best worked films that David Fincher has given us that is The social network despite not being totally perfect the director knows how to transfer a current story to the cinematographic field in a way that is strong enough so as not to depend on the real protagonists and the name Facebook since the film is capable of supporting itself,10

1 October 2010,The very definition of a modern masterpiece,What I think is going to make The Social Network such a sensation is that it can be experienced in a number of different ways On one hand it s an extremely intriguing look at a fascinating 21st century event that people don t really know much about moving at a pace that matches the wits of the film s brilliant protagonists On another level it s a movie that absolutely sums up the way the world has changed during the Digital Age you don t have to be likable persuasive or forceful like the Winklevoss twins who Zuckerberg duped to succeed in an era where nerdy little college students can become billionaires from their computers If you aren t particularly interested in the founding of Facebook or the film s representation of the Digital Age you can still view it in a totally different context It s a movie about youth in the 21st century people who think they re connected via Facebook and texting but really live in a state of disconnect The film deals with a wide variety of main characters most of whom are college aged and each of these characters is in some way deformed Zuckerberg cannot relate to others Parker is morally corrupt Eduardo cannot properly run his business Eduardo s girlfriend is literally insane and the Winklevi are almost inhumanly strong creatures yet somehow can t handle the scrawny kid who stole their idea Viewed as nothing more than a study on America s current generation which isn t nearly the focus of the film The Social Network is already an incredible accomplishment And while each of these pieces plays a significant role in shaping this film into something great what makes it for me an extraordinary film a masterpiece even is a radically different aspect of the movie Through the pen of Aaron Sorkin the eye of David Fincher and the performance of Jesse Eisenberg the character of Mark Zuckerberg stands as one of the most tragic figures of loneliness in the history of film Every single frame of the movie complements this notion In the opening scene Mark sits at a distance from his date with her final words being It s because you re an as shole before storming off Mark runs home alone and essentially crafts Facebook out of his anger and seclusion while other Harvard geniuses party he works at his laptop As the film progresses the camera almost always catches him standing alone sitting alone away and apart from other people often people with whom he is interacting He can t even feel close to his friends His hands are often contained within his sweater pockets burying him within himself Sorkin s harsh words and the blistering pace at which Eisenberg recites them frame him into somebody by whom we are fascinated but to whom we could never truly relate Despite all that money and success he isn t somebody we wish we were This portrait of desolation and heartache which is often powerful enough to move one to tears paired with an entertaining depiction of Facebook s creation which is often hilarious enough to move one to tears as well as an incredible ensemble cast gorgeous cinematography pitch perfect musical work by Trent Reznor impeccable editing and a poignant ending that brings the themes of the story full circle The Social Network is a film that makes conversations cool again something that hasn t been true since Pulp Fiction a film that defines our generation and times in a way that a film hasn t done since possibly The Graduate a film that can be enjoyed by virtually anybody above the age of 13 a film that I know I will watch a few more times in theaters and an experience I and soon to be you won t forget for quite some time In fact it will probably resonate with us longer than will Facebook itself,10
2 May 2020,Young,The world belongs to young people Young people don t need to follow the rules They just need to create the rules Young people can gain a foothold by stretching their personality It also inadvertently tells everyone that the information age is an era of robbers and everything must be fast Not to mention any delays everything should be resolved in the fastest and decisive way The movie also shows that no matter how advanced the development of technology is how people coexist is the most basic problem to be solved by a society,8
5 December 2010,The Social Network: 10/10,Interestingly enough Hollywood had decided to make a movie about a boring subject the making of Facebook The story was supposed to be just a mess with lawsuits and betrayal of friends But writer Aaron Sorkin turned the story into a must see of the decade He turned it into a witty fast paced thrilling and an Oscar winning script Luckily The Social Network got David Fincher Curious Case of Benjamin Button as a director which makes it even better David Fincher s achievement in this film is going to score him another Oscar nod Fincher is directing The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo English version my favourite book The actual Facebook story is about Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg a Harvard undergraduate computer genius who wrote the code for the Facebook website Teaming up with him was him roommate Eduardo Saverin whom later sued him for well lots of Mark ran into playboy Sean Parker who convinced Mark to betray his partner Eduardo that s what lead to the law suit Though people say Aaron Sorkin s script is an inaccurate portray of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg who in real life is down to Earth and not an like in the story I say he was just trying to make the story A LITTLE more interesting than it already is sarcasm Aaron Sorkin not only made the story more interesting he made it smarter and more thrilling Performance wise I will have to admit that I think The Social Network will dominate the Oscars in the acting categories Jesse Eisenberg gave one hell of a performance Since he had been playing a loser with no girlfriend kind of guy this is really typical for him His fast talking and annoying ass attitude really stole every scene that the camera sets on him Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake also gave fine dramatic performances which MIGHT earn them an Oscar nod But in terms of Jesse Eisenberg he is guaranteed an Oscar nomination he might even win considering there is no other good movies this time of year Directing writing and acting all great in one movie is rare to say the least The Social Network succeeds in every assets that the film was trying to achieve,10
12 March 2019,Best Biopic of 2010.,Watched this for the nth time This film is one of the masterpieces of modern cinema David Fincher managed to make a film about an autobiography something that give a fictional air and I really appreciate it Also the lines Aaron Sorkin did a great job as a screenwriter The cast is a perfect thing I really could believe that Jesse Eisenberg was the real Mark Zuckerberg I love this man two Armie Hammer Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin shines the most I could not love this movie more,8
22 October 2010,Left a real Mark...,Facebook We all use it most of us love it so it was a matter of time before someone made a movie out of it Hailed to be on par with the invention of the telephone Mark Zuckerberg s gargantuan internet phenomena has infected the world with a brand spanking new form of communication 500 million people worldwide have found themselves lost in a realm of friend requests statuses tagging news feeds and all sorts of innovative little tid bits Bit of fun right Well I think we can afford to be a bit more profound Facebook isn t just an exercise in escapist entertainment it s trivialised the process of communication in its entirety figure heading an explosive online movement fixed on harmonising global liaison Who d have thought that such an immense world changing concept could have come from one geek messing around in his little university dorm It s a remarkable story that ached for an effective big screen adaptation Was this ache throbbing in vain Definitely not But be aware folks this isn t just a flat out glorification of Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg Aaron Sorkin s witty script paints a genuine portrait of the cyber magnate revealing his stark flaws as he battles a potentially crippling law suit Jesse Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg in a role which grew to be more complex and multi faceted than first thought Being a relative newcomer and in my opinion emerging star all eyes were on this young actor Does he have the ability to hold such a biopic Can he conjure the ultimate technological hero or even anti hero These were questions I had to ask beforehand and God did I feel stupid as I walked out Eisenberg perfectly captures the essence of flawed genius delivering Sorkin s portrayal of Zuckerberg with ruthless efficiency Rather than shoving Zuckerberg s genius down our throats the script leaves his likability wide open On one end he s obnoxious irreverent socially awkward and incredibly controlling Whilst on the other he s a misunderstood brilliant aficionado driven by mere passion uninterested in monetary needs Personally I fell in love with Eisenberg s interpretation of Sorkin s script he was mesmerisingly dry punchy and deeply absorbing He s produced a character that will grow to become one of cinema s great flawed protagonists In terms of plot The Social Network pulls the Facebook creation story out by the roots and examines each twine with cracking detail It drags us back to a time before the site s global explosion a world where Zuckerberg is only known by his blogging alias Zukonit and his cyber creation is in the mere faetal stage being classed as a book of faces or The Facebook This was only 6 or 7 years ago but it seems millennia has gone by This little fallacy symbolises the extraordinary rapidity of the spread of Facebook s infection across the world making this picture eagerly fascinating Every day all of us are drawn to check our Facebooks we meet new people and it s become a custom to ask if they re on Facebook Don t worry I ll Facebook you You have that Facebook app Can t believe you just fraped me are but just a few sentences drummed into the status quo This site has become an impenetrable feature of our society and witnessing its fruition from the very beginning captivates beyond all recognition So with Aaron Sorkin s sharp script and Jesse Eisenberg s impressive performance all the film needed was some solid direction of the likes David Fincher was happy to oblige Fincher truly is a strong director helming such pictures as Zodiac 2007 Fight Club 1999 Seven 1995 and just recently The Curious Case of Benjamin Button 2008 Like Ron Howard he doesn t overstate with his work he possesses the maturity and discipline to direct a film that allows the story and characters to develop freely as the screenplay initially intended He s the liberal middle man rendering a script through the camera in a smooth majestic manner As much as I d hate to use the word standard here Fincher s camera work is standard in method yet far beyond standard in quality it fits the script like a glove So without further ado let s knuckle down and discuss the Academy Awards All of sudden we ve drifted into awards season the most exciting time of the cinematic year where the pains inflicted by the tripe blurted onto the summer screen are eased by a parade of fresh top quality cinema A new wave of technical scrutiny will hit viewers like a ton of bricks and The Social Network is one hell of an opener to this stimulating advent To revert back to Eisenberg he s sent ripples around cinema s critical forum and rightfully so He s pulled off a career changing performance emblematic of his blossoming into the great actor he ll very soon become We ll expect to see him floating around the Best Leading Actor category across the award ceremonies but a win seems unlikely As for Sorkin s expertly written script it should expect top contention for Best Adapted Screenplay and I can see a few supporting actors attracting recognition The striking Achilles Heel for the film s promotion has been the inclusion of pop prince Justin Timberlake in the cast In the world of REAL cinema his name falls under taboo But he s actually pretty bearable this time around playing the super slick founder of Napster Sean Parker So try not to let that ghastly name impair your excitement If you re worried that The Social Network is just a lousy pop carnation programmed to juice the money out of the Facebook loving public you couldn t be more wrong David Fincher s picture is a magnetic analysis of troubled genius personified by an exceptional Eisenberg performance What a dose of post summer refreshment,8
30 December 2011,were no women offended by this film?,Besides being a cartoon of characters none of whom I cared about the film s portrayal of women was astonishing Nearly every female role was written with such condescension women were brainless drug fiending whorish and in one scene insane was it supposed to be enough OK that Zuckerberg pined for the woman who dared to scorn him Or that they threw in the lawyer who spoke truth to him If I hadn t been so irritated I would have laughed at this silly movie i would guess no one portrayed or referred to is happy with it except perhaps Larry Somers,3
31 January 2011,"Good, not great",The Social Network is a well crafted film detailing the trials and tribulations of Facebook s founding It was interesting to get a sense of the coding process and whatnot by which such a website comes to be Everyone concerned does a fine job However once one has acquainted oneself with the pertinent facts in the story it oughtn t be that difficult to offer up a proper accounting thereof in the form of a motion picture For me The Social Network is interesting with no rewatch value to speak of It seems too self aggrandizing to laud the film for its relevance to our time The advent of websites like Facebook and YouTube seems rather obvious given the attending circumstances I say so knowing I ll still be saying so in years to come as other people profit astronomically in a likewise fashion,7
28 October 2010,Fincher and Sorkin in complete harmony,Prior to its release if one peg could be attached to David Fincher s The Social Network it would be The Facebook Movie However now that the finished product has seen the light of day the only peg that applies is work of art That evolution from opportunism to genuinely fascinating artistic expression is a major part of what makes The Social Network work so well So how did this happen Turns out good old fashioned movie making can take you as far as you re willing to go Beginning at a script level screenwriter Aaron Sorkin has devised a narrative that touches eternal themes of friendship betrayal and class It is also expertly put together by Fincher who avoids his usual visual trickery as in the adrenaline fueled punch drunk photography in his Fight Club in favor of a more sedate and clinical approach to the material The film begins on a chilly late fall evening in a college town dive bar Wild noise crowds the soundtrack as the audience joins two voices one male the other female in mid conversation The scene is a verbal high wire act between Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg and Erica Albright Rooney Mara who will break up with Mark by the scene s end The two fire back witty exchanges of dialogue that force the audience to adjust to a much faster pace than they are accustomed to That is the method of this movie moving at high intellectual speeds and expecting the audience to keep up Sorkin s screenplay forgoes the tiresome process of explain how a website is created and instead focuses on strict character development It doesn t matter if the audience doesn t know a single line of computer code because it is always so obvious that the main characters know what they re talking about It is important to know how smart these character are and how passionate they are about what they re doing The Social Network is essentially a movie with a revolving point of view shifting from Zuckerberg to Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield and the Winkevoss twins both played in a feat of stunning special effects by Armie Hammer All claim to have a large share in the creation of Facebook and their legal depositions provide the movie s flashback structure The Social Network forces the audience to sit up and actively engage in what is happening on screen This is a movie where allegiance will shift from character to character and the truth always seems tenuous and uncertain Some have claimed that the vague nature of truth offered by Fincher and Sorkin discredits the entire picture Nothing is further from the truth A movie even one based on a true story can do what it wishes with the facts so long as it remains compelling Other articles have termed the film a hack job against Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg I would completely disagree with that notion Both Fincher and Sorkin are notorious perfectionists in their given fields and their empathy for Zuckerberg is what lingers with audience well after the closing credits We may never like Zuckerberg but Sorkin and Fincher let us in on trying to understand him That is the true story of the movie It s not The Facebook Movie it s a character study of the highest order,10
2 October 2010,Fantastic movie.,This movie was great Everything was fantastic The pacing the acting the BRILLIANT writing and the directing The cast was excellent as well Everyone played their parts perfectly especially Andrew Garfield He s my favorite new actor I know he s been in some other things but this really did it for me Jesse Eisenberg was great Justin Timberlake great Andew Garfield FANTASTIC And everyone else was good too I hated that Rooney Mara was barely in the movie That really bothered me The writing was marvelous It so fast paced and everything was happening so fast I loved it It perfectly executed what Facebook was about and I just loved every second of it I highly HIGHLY recommend this to everyone It s one of the best movies of the year and I m really hoping this gets some Oscar nods 9 5 10,9
27 February 2011,The Facebook's Movie is F***ing awesome.....,In my opinion The Social Network is a best surprise of 2010 It just blew me away I could never guess what this was all about The writing direction acting editing original score editing and cinematography were brilliant Fincher has proved his versatility Every time new genre but awesome stuff I deeply respect him He is one of the few directors who have made all of their movies up to the mark All of the content in the movie are compelling the story being true isn t the strongest which certainly is OK considering reality but the way story has been told is mind blowing I can see why all the critics are raving about it I personally liked it very much and didn t see any negative point I d rather say its near perfect considering all the situations that its recent its true and its not what every one would like to hear about But when seen as a movie The Social Network is probably the best picture of 2010 9 5 10,10
3 July 2013,A Relationship Destroyed By Ego And Ambition,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,10
31 October 2010,Difficult subject done exceptionally well,The thought of a movie about Facebook sounded awful But the movie is actually very good Most movies about computers are terrible and it s a difficult subject to make a movie about But Fincher manages it There is a great deal of dialogue in this film so you have to pay attention If you do you will be rewarded with some interesting and intelligent dialogue The acting is good by everyone involved but particularly the lead actor It s great to see a movie celebrating intelligence It s as close as you can come to glamorising Computer Science Some of the other reviews in my opinion exaggerate how good this movie is It s no classic Just an intelligent well directed interesting movie about the cultural phenomenon that is Facebook But American Beauty it ain t A smart movie for smart people Recommended,8
15 January 2011,Baby your a rich man and a great mo-vie,About three years ago Columbia Pictures released 21 a docudrama about a group of collage students who changed the face of the card game Blackjack However 21 was awarded with poor reviews and made 82 million in the U S So why did I put a short review of 21 in my review of The Social Network Well let me tell you this The true story of 21 had white actors playing African Americans while The Social Network was true with the characters in real life Yes I know that in both movies some have untrue facts mostly 21 but This movie has more than 21 It s not just about the beginning of Facebook and ConnectU its also a tale of the Demons in life greed drugs booze and sex Anyway long story short The Social Network is one of those good movies that doesn t want to go out and letting the bad movies come out We need a film that s like this one well acted directed and written That makes The Social Network one of the greatest films of all time,10
9 October 2010,An unlikely gem about an unlikely sensation,When it was announced that Hollywood was going to make a movie about the founding of Facebook no one including me expected it to succeed How could anyone turn a seemingly mundane subject such as Internet communication into a worthwhile film Moreover why would anyone want to It appeared to be nothing more than Hollywood trying to cash in on the latest cultural phenomenon a move no less sleazy than say churning out endless sequels to a tired franchise And yet David Fincher and his team managed to not only prevent The Social Network from becoming an embarrassing failure but they transformed it into one of the most critically acclaimed movies of the year and a prime Oscar contender How did they do it With The Social Network Columbia Pictures faced the particularly tricky task of promoting a movie that despite its much admired director and screenwriter held little evident appeal to any audience mainstream or indie Nonetheless with subtle efficiency Columbia managed to assemble a clever advertising campaign that steadily garnered the film hype a simple poster featuring star Jesse Eisenberg and a catchy tagline a riveting theatrical trailer that highlighted the movie s dark sense of humor and explosive arguments and ultimately it was clear that this was not a high budget thriller or a quirky comedy but an intelligent character driven drama aimed primarily at adults an increasingly rare genre nowadays The buzz turned into legitimate excitement once The Social Network premiered at the New York Film Festival to glowing reviews Still hype does not always translate to success see Changeling The Lovely Bones The Social Network fortunately escaped the fates of those early Oscar favorites turned critical duds with help from the sure hands of director David Fincher writer Aaron Sorkin and a cast of young up and coming actors Arguably the most impressive aspect of the movie and certainly the most likely to acquire awards attention Aaron Sorkin s screenplay is a labyrinth of wit suspense and twists the dialogue zipping like balls in a pinball machine Sorkin most famous for penning 1992 s A Few Good Men and the beloved TV show The West Wing shows off his deft hand with legal issues generating tension and excitement from the most mundane activities such as people discussing copyright laws at a conference table which absorbs a generous portion of the movie By telling the story through flashbacks he weaves a beguiling mosaic of conflicted voices and hidden motivations an intricate web of lies and betrayal rejecting black and white ideals in favor of moral ambiguity and flawed even despicable characters This is a screenplay any aspiring writer myself included would admire and envy The cast a truly impressive ensemble delivers Sorkin s lines with deceptive ease virtually disappearing into their respective characters a feat most likely assisted by their collective anonymity In a surprising yet inspired move director David Fincher warned the actors against interacting with their real life counterparts as movie stars often do when portraying real people discouraging them from doing impersonations instead of bona fide performances Amid the universally solid supporting cast Armie Hammer and Josh Pence stand out as Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss respectively even though Pence was faceless and voiceless employing technology similar that used in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button Fincher superimposed Hammer s face on Pence s body in an effort to make the non related actors appear identical Nonetheless it cannot be denied that the stars of the film at least visibly are its three male leads By far the most well known cast member Justin Timberlake proves here for once and all that he has the talent needed to succeed in the film industry that the promise shown in 2007 s Alpha Dog was no fluke As disgraced Napster co founder Sean Parker he exudes aplomb and charisma the kind of brazen confidence one can expect only from a person well acquainted with the world of celebrity and fame and he manages to create sympathy if only a little for a vastly unlikable character by lending Parker a hint of childlike optimism along with the conceited swagger In the most emotional role of the film Andrew Garfield imbues Eduardo Sauverin with passion and drive holding his own against his more well known costars Of the actors he arguably has the best chance at nabbing awards attention as he gets a plethora of scenes to show off his budding talent Personally though I was most astonished by Jesse Eisenberg the fresh faced lead whose previous movie credits include 2009 s Adventureland and Zombieland Here it is obvious that he is more than another Michael Cera playing Mark Zuckerberg as an arrogant yet socially awkward genius whose ambition and frustration override his central integrity He remains for the most part emotionally detached articulating Sorkin s lines with flawless deadpan acidity and relying largely on verbal nuances and body language to convey his character s feelings yet he is so electric so comfortable that the audience has no trouble connecting to him Possessing the maturity of actors twice his age Eisenberg deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance Lastly one cannot overlook the efforts of David Fincher and his technical crew Utilizing mostly dark and mute shades Fincher gives The Social Network a bleak yet polished vibe with significant help from the gorgeously atmospheric score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross which swerves between melancholy and vivacious without difficulty Also editors Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall do an impeccable job of intertwining the past and present story lines Against all odds The Social Network has defied expectations and become a legitimate critical and box office hit Skillfully assembled by a team of both veterans and amateurs and alive with humor and pathos it is a film about friendship and rivalry truth and fiction The Social Network explores the fragility of human connections the psychological barriers we erect to protect ourselves from each other,9
5 July 2018,Great David Fincher movie and a must watch for fans of drama.,David Fincher is a genius filmmaker one of the very few true auteurs who can sell a movie on their name alone Combine that with the screenplay being penned by Aaron Sorkin and the expectations for the social network were sky high and thankfully the film is good really good It charts the beginnings of Zuckerberg s empire and traverses through everything he goes through Brilliantly paced amazingly lit and well acted by all the young stars at hand this is a film you should watch regardless of your opinion or interest in Facebook,8
23 October 2010,"I ""like"" it.",When I first found out that there was going to be a film about the founding of Facebook I wasn t really interested But then I heard that it would be by David Fincher it immediately became something to keep an eye on The film sounded really strange a drama film about Facebooks creation Well I didn t really know anything about that event but could a website be enough to make a film of unless it was a documentary Since David Fincher is one of my favourite directors and hasn t made a bad film since Alien 3 I kept hopeful that this still could be something worth watching When the rave reviews started coming in I was surprised but still held my expectations down The trailer looked great but that has fooled me before The film turned out to exceed all my wildest hopes One clearly sees why this is not called Facebok the movie because it is not really about the website It s a story about people friendship betrayal money and much more So even if not interested in Facebook this is a great movie The story is great and brilliantly told actually very deep emotionally Aaron Sorkin is the master of razor sharp dialogue Not just is it gripping because the characters are real and the story is based on actual event The acting is among the best I have seen in ages Jesse Eisenberg Andrew Garfield Rooney Mara Armie Hammer even Justin Timberlake are simply amazing So there is much talking in the film not like Fincher s usual kind of movies but no less brilliant The camera work is superb just like always It goes at a quick pace but it s never any problem to keep up The music is great and perfectly chosen for the tone It s funny and sad at the same time I don t care much if it s accurate portrayal of what happened They have succeeded great in not taking anyones side It is left to you to decide who is most right But it doesn t matter since it s one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen Never has 2h gone so by so quickly The Social Network is the best film of 2010 and maybe one of the biggest surprises ever better than I ever dared to hope for David Fincher s best film since Fight club The material that they based it on turned out to be pretty good stuff but never did I even imagine that this could be so amazing execution When it was over I just wanted to see it again and again The Social Network is fantastic The movie for a generation,9
27 April 2020,Very Captivating,A very entertaining and well made movie It has an interesting story it is well written with strong dialog and well directed The cast and the performances and perfect The story is presented possibly in the perfect way possible The movie doesn t try to make Zuckerberg look like a angel but tells the true story behind facebook I love the pacing of this movie,8
4 January 2022,Fun Film - Sorkin A Hit,This is a fun film and will be a classic to be watched over the years Aaron Sorkin another hit Any documentation films will have some inadequate information in the storyline Jesse Eisenburg put in a well deserved performance along with Rooney Mara,8
3 July 2011,Yay.,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,9
4 May 2014,"Its good, but what am I not getting here?",I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,7
14 November 2010,A dialogue-driven movie,This movie has been receiving unprecedented praise and this naturally leads one to ask is it worth it Well a reserved yes Reserved because I can t say that it will become an influential film it certainly may become a classic film but besides from a sharper read quick intelligence dialogue it doesn t offer anything new or open up new directions for cinema aspects I would consider for overwhelming praise What the film does do however is bring together its cinematography screenplay music acting and all other cinematic elements in such an intelligent and entertaining way that is rarely seen in Hollywood movies To watch this movie you don t need to have facebook in fact you don t even have to care about it of course these things will help as in jokes and nods to teenage society are found throughout This is not a movie for people with facebook nor is it necessarily about it at least in its effect on society but rather it is about the creator s Basing it around the people involved means it becomes a film about real relationships and not screen to screen ones If Fincher decided to focus the film on the influence of facebook then it would have become a quasi documentary Instead it is a drama with the screenplay echoing the rapid fire dialogue seen in many plays which isn t a surprise considering Sorkin is also a playwright It certainly isn t natural speech but it didn t need to be This isn t supposed to be a mirror of reality it is too polished for that instead it is a loosely true story represented as entertainment and the witty dialogue is used to create the intellectual atmosphere of Harvard and its characters Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg the founder does a great job as a person who has an idea and wants to create it himself But for this he will have to rely on others This is where Eduardo played by Andrew Garfield comes in with the money to finance it all What Eduardo brings to the movie is what lifts it into the higher echelons of film the delicacy and balance of human relationships Without this it would be a nice movie with a nice storyline that is nicely filmed We get that from a lot of Hollywood productions see Inception but Sorkin and Fincher are able to add a depth and complication to the characters that ultimately drives the already interesting story More than any other character Eduardo is similar to us he is down to earth wants to make money and does not possess a freakish talent and thus we can empathize with him Zuckerberg is different from us and this is what makes him a fascinating subject We do not know what to make of him and are left with the question posed throughout the movie is he really an asshole http waitingforthrenos blogspot com,9
14 February 2022,Andrew Garfield can friend me,I m going to try my very best to look at The Social Network purely as a work of fiction because if you try to pick at the thread of hmm how factually real is this story or hmm what do I really think of these real life figures who are still alive and doing business on The Facebook you re going to lose your mind With that being said Aaron Sorkin s a master screenwriter and the depth and quality of his dialogue is captured beautifully in the hands of someone else directing and having that someone be David Fincher no less I will say though I just never felt sympathy for Mark Zuckerberg and I had all the sympathy in the world for Eduardo Saverin as presented in the film Andrew Garfield gave an incredible performance and I think the reason the movie works so well is that while I didn t feel sympathy for Jesse Eisenberg s Zuckerberg and loved to hate Justin Timberlake s Sean Parker the screenplay and directing didn t force the audience with no other choice The Social Network is a great multidimensional story that will stay with me Ann Perkins,9
20 June 2020,An editing and dialogue masterpiece,Mark Zuckerberg the lizard alien gets his own movie with a person playing him in the most opposite way as possible David Finher is well known for his detailed adaptation skills for Zodiac but this movie is different but it highly pays off Mark s starting girlfriend is frictional but it serves the ending of him sending her friend request Jesse Eisenberg plays the role phenomenally and his presence will stick with me forever The witty quick fast high IQ dialogues with masterfully crafted edites make this movie hell of fun to watch On top it is a very entertaining film with tremendous acting skills shown by both Jesse and Andrew Garfield The movie focuses on two different legal battle taking place in different times but the movie shifts back and forth without losing a single bit Also telling the origin story of Facebook This movie is adapted from Andrews real life person s written book so we feel emotional for him a lot I love how they didn t waste time to explain exposition scenes of programming and straight up talked in their coding language to make us feel watching actual nerds figure it out Dialogues of changing the world creating the next big thing instead of going to parties are inspiring in my eyes,9
16 October 2018,Fincher rolls on into gold status with Social Network,David Fincher can now be considered in the ranks of legends or at least modern masters a list that includes Tarantino Denis Villeneuve and Soderberg and PT Anderson Penned by scribe supreme Aaron Sorkin the film details the creation of Facebook and the circumstances surrounding its inception The acting is top notch as is the visual and production design aspect The film makes you feel amidst a giant maze of campus buildings sometime around Fall and under the direction of Fincher all this boils into a fantastic drama brimming with the age old codes of envy and jealousy This is a must watch for anyone,
1 February 2011,Racist and blinded by the whiteness.,Did they really say Asians can t dance I will bitch slap the writer who put that into the script I can t stand how there s no diversity in this movie I never wanted to see this but started because it won so many awards I said fine I ll give it a try and not long before it started did it annoy me The music sucks The music should not be noticed thats why its called background music Its too loud and does not fit the scenes I still don t understand why this movie is doing so well This movie just shows what America really appreciates political bull crap,1

1 March 2023,Couldn't stand more than a few minutes,I downloaded this movie to my iPad from Netflix to watch on a plane flight Settled into my seat and started the movie After a few minutes of really annoying gibberish between the couple at the party I decided that was enough Can t put my finger on it but it just annoyed me They were talking but just not making any sense Luckily I had another movie downloaded that I could watch in its place or it would have been a boring flight As I didn t get any further than that that is pretty much the whole review I suppose it would appeal to someone but it wasn t a movie for me I gave it one star,1

29 December 2010,Nice movie,I thought I was gonna watch another ridiculous blockbuster but in fact it was the opposite The movie at its totality keeps a nice pace it doesn t make you feel tired or willing to scream at some point That s it Justin Timberlake is a good surprise I must admit It is not an Academy Awards play however I ve seen a lot of worse things But Jesse Eisenberg is such a good actor that he doesn t need to make a huge effort to prove it Softly as the movie goes he makes his character as big as the Mark Zuckenberg s bank account By the way Mark on this movie is seen as a genius fast non sociable person in other words the villain But is he I don t think so Andrew Garfield s character Eduardo Saverin the Brazilian Facebook co founder is kind of double crossed by Mark in Eduardo s point of view but he knew that it might happen The Winklevoss twins are the really victims on this whole situation in my opinion Their idea was completely stolen and as we say in Brazil it became Mark s golden chicken,9

15 March 2011,The Best...Best...Best...Best...Best Film Ever Made!,In the very first 5 minutes of The Social Network we get to see Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg and his girlfriend Erica Rooney Mara the future Girl with the Dragon Tattoo do nothing but talk talk and talk in a bar He speaks a lot of nonsense she speaks a lot of truth clarity and disadvantage When he disrespects her she strikes him back and calls him an A hole This strikes him to make disrespectful comments about her on his blog and create a website which will become the most legendary web site ever It all started when Zuckerberg and his friends including Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield the future Spider Man created a website called Facemash a website that ultimately becomes a crash site for the all the Harvard students to see which girl is hot or not This catches the attention of the Winklevoss twins Cameron and Tyler Armie Hammer with body doubling by Josh Pence and their friend Divya Max Minghella who wants Mark to create a website in order to check their basic status With that Zuckerberg and Saverin created Facebook the ultimate website This causes controversy for the twins but causes a big success with the help of Napster creator Sean Parker Justin Timberlake bravura of a performance and ultimately causes a lot of disparagement by both Saverin and Zuckerberg If you got 2 hours 120 minutes to spare and you have an ear for dialogue then The Social Network is that kind of movie Sure Zuckerberg can be an A hole but at least he is the youngest billionaire in the world You can hate him or you can like him but that is the point The Oscar winning screenplay by Aaron Sorkin is truly pure and original dialogue at its best The direction of David Fincher and the use of digital cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth is brilliant Everything has to be perfect this is why the film itself is a big hit Be sure to listen to the Oscar winning score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross and listen very carefully The cast including Eisenberg Garfield Timberlake Hammer Brenda Song and Mara are perfect I may not be a user of Facebook my mom uses it but I think this movie itself is already like the new Facebook But be careful this is from the A hole guy who invented it and basically created a whole new aspect about it As Marylin Delpy Rashida Jones puts it to him You re not an asshole Mark You re just trying so hard to be It s funny outrageous powerful gut wrenching a punch you in the jaw kind of film that is without a doubt the best film ever made Truly the best film ever made Period,10

19 January 2011,West Wing: Student Edition,I knew I wasn t going to like this movie It s about some snotty elitist privileged kids at Harvard who don t have to work at Pizza Hut to get through school so they have plenty of time to enjoy their lives and join social clubs that will ultimately populate the West Wing No worries about health care here But curiosity got the better of me and I finally broke down largely because of David Fincher whose storytelling abilities i admire his films being favorites Seven Benjamin Button Zodiac Facebook does not quite fit the list Although I hated the movie largely because of its a hole protagonist I admired the filmmaking the cinematography musical score and narrative flow were sublime I hated the West Wing cadence of the dialogue and wonder if the actors had to be trained to talk that way The only writer filmmaker who can do that superbly in my view is David Mamet Here really all the West Wing cast kept swimming before my eyes The other problem with this movie for me nobody likes an a hole kid protagonist The guy lied and stole ideas from friends and acquaintances the American way No wonder Goldman Sachs put so much of its blood money into the company,7
13 January 2019,Hard To Believe... My Favourite Movie,The Social Network is an incredible film I know it s edgy to say that it s my favourite of all time but it really is I could watch it over and over it just never gets old The score is phenomenal the directing is exquisite the screenplay is incredibly written with snappy dialogue and great storytelling performances are just top notch cinematography is beautiful everything is brilliant The idea of the creation of Facebook might not appeal to some but this is surprisingly a captivating and moving story Cheers to Aaron Sorkin,10
11 May 2020,The Social Network,David Fincher directs The Social Network A film detailing the events of Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg creating the social networking site that would become known as Facebook and how he is sued by the twins who claimed he stole their idea and by the co founder who was later squeezed out of the business This film is a very well made and captivating film The performances from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield are stunning standouts Fincher directs this film in a great way as its riveting score excellent editing and cinematography give this film which doesn t necessarily deal the darkest of subjects a somewhat intense and dark aesthetic to it The script is brillant as this is a film that relys heavily on dialogue so the script had to be great This film deals with true events leaving it no room for narrative creation but it still packs a heavy punch As this film is relevant important sophisticated engaging in every way and depicts the relations of business and ideas and the choices that lead to the future The film really explodes in a good way when the arguments over rights and business opportunities happen between Zuckerberg and Savrin Jesse Eisenberg turns the character into someone you d love to hate yet cant quite seem to as he is a very sensible and intelligent asshole The dialogue is slick and powerful and the way the past and at the time present is interwoven together is masterfully crafted and structured This film is razor sharp in many ways The film is not intense in the usual way but more through dialogue and the emotion of characters And in the end Mark Zuckerberg realizes his petty nature The film is about relationships and freinds and what they mean in the digital age He feels bad for screwing Eduardo and using him Mark spends most of the film attempting to distinguish himself Eduardo saw through Sean s facade while Mark didn t Mark is just trying to make Facebook the best that it can be until the end he does the first human thing of the entire film and reaches to someone expressing remorse Or it could be seen as Mark revealing his shallow nature and depicting his isolation even though he has money and power,9

4 March 2011,The 452nd review of a film about someone who now has a piece of all of us,Difficult to add to everything that s been written so I ll attack this obliquely Aaron Sorkin s script drives the actors and the story and it s a very well written script I ve read it and it does have a sense or urgency and discovery straight off the page which translates very well into a fascinating and hyper realistic version of the truth If you didn t already know the film charts the rise of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard and his journey from dorm geek to billionaire and the subject of countless law suits If you are one of the few people who do not use Facebook then this film will have less of an impact on you that s for sure but I think that the inter relationship between Zuckerberg his initial partner Edouardo Saverin and their nemeses The Winklevi is fascinating My favorite parts of the movie are where people wrongly under estimate Zuckerberg and he surprises them closely followed by the Winklevi trip to Larry Summers office which doesn t end quite as they expected 9 out of 10,9

8 October 2010,I'll be posting a link to this review onto my facebook page!,From the director David FINCHER The Curious case of Benjamin Button Fight Club Se7en THE SOCIAL NETWORK is the story of the development and rise and rise of the world wide Social Networking phenomena FACEBOOK Shortly after breaking up with his girlfriend Harvard computer nurd Mark Zuckerberg JESSE EISENBERG sits down at his computer and blogs bad things about his now ex girlfriend and in an act of revenge decides to create a website where students can grade the girls within the university News of the site goes around like wildfire and they get hundreds of students accessing it and an idea was born the power of the internet as a revolutionary new communication medium for social networking Many began to see the potential in the new social medium and attempt to jump on the bandwagon and get in at an early stage with the hapless Winklevoss brothers claiming to have spawned the original idea of having a unique Harvard exclusive social site many tried and many fail but it is the Mark Zuckerberg s tenacity and clarity of focus with THE FACEBOOK site launched in Feb 2004 that forces it s way through the dead wood and grows and grows in popularity at a phenomenal speed and pretty soon it has expanded to many of the other universities and schools As a computer genius come geek Zuckerberg is himself a social misfit that finds human interaction and communication difficult and he turns to his one true friend Eduardo Saverin ably played by Andrew Garfield for financial support in setting up the servers routers and infrastructure required to cope with the every increasing demand for the Facebook site Zuckerberg and Saverin decide to jointly split the company they create 70 30 in favour of Zuckerberg Things progress well until Saverin decides there is a need for more investment and to get advertisers interested a move which Zuckerberg opposes claiming that it would detract from the purity of the Facebook idea Meanwhile on the scene comes the another headlining entrepreneur way ahead of his time Sean Parker played excellently by Justin Timberlake the founder and genius behind NAPSTER and music downloading sharing site Fresh from a recent legal defeat against the Music industry over Napster Sean still believes he has won by changing the face of the music industry forever And he is chomping at the bit for a new challenge and sees THE FACEBOOK as the next big thing he is actually the one who suggested renaming it to just FACEBOOK There follows a series on wide parties and roller coaster wheeling and dealings and Sean Parker eventually engineers a situation where there is finally a breakdown in relationships between Zuckerberg and Saverin and they go their separate ways The film is primarily based around the legal dispute of over ownership of Facebook brand and intellectual copy write of the product by the Winklevoss brothers and Eduardo Saverin against Zuckerberg with flashbacks to previous times elaborating on claims and counter claims made during the case Launched in February 2004 Facebook was born and a mere six years and 500 million friends later making Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history but as the tagline for the film states you don t get 500 Million friends without making some enemies I must admit after seeing Jesse Eisenberg s awful performances in the truly woeful Zombieland and Adventureland movies I really didn t hold out much hope for his acting career but I was pleasantly surprised in this instance as in the Social Network he is better still not great but he can actually act With no real heavy weights in the acting cast this was a film that had to stand up and fight with a decent story line which I was quite impressed with being a true and interesting story As a trivia side point the director of this movie David Fincher will also be taking the reins to direct the Americanised version God help us all of the remake of excellent THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO along with Rooney Mara who plays Erica Albright in the Social Network taking on the leading role of Lisbeth Salander I imagine that this will be a popular movie as almost everyone I know has a facebook account and I ll even be posting a link to this review onto my facebook page,7
26 March 2014,Hollywood-ized Docu-Drama,I really didn t have much interest in this movie until I saw that the screenplay was written by Aaron Sorkin and I have so far loved all things Sorkin though I have so far been unconvinced by West Wing ites to check that series out Sorkin s work always centers on rapid fire dialog and smartassery and this film has no shortage of either From his media appearances I don t believe for a second that the real Mark Zuckerberg was as calm cool and ruthless as portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg but a nerdy portrayal wouldn t have worked in the film On a scale of rewatchability I can t say I d go higher than 6 10 but for the superb acting and scripting I must rate it higher 8 10,8
19 February 2011,At least interesting....,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,7
2 October 2010,"Does ""The Social Network"" Define an Entire Generation?",Early reviews of The Social Network claimed that the film based upon the book The Accidental Billionaires about the sordid history of Facebook defined an entire generation When one gets passed all of the hyperbolic praise and adulation I would say that The Social Network is indeed a very well made film It does indeed sum up the 00 s in a way that no other film has done so far And much like previous films about generational conflicts The Social Network takes a snapshot of how young people socially interact with one another in the new millennium Still many people have accused the film of doing a hatchet job on Facebook s CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg but I would argue that this film does no such thing Instead this is a film where Zuckerberg is portrayed as a rather ruthless character with the drive to take Facebook as far as it could possibly go No one else in the cast despite their accusations of being ripped off by Zuckerberg had this driving force behind them Simply put if you would have invented Facebook then you would have invented it It isn t original ideas that have made Zuckerberg a multi billionaire but being in the right place at the right time riding the ascending cultural wave of a major fad It is this moral ambiguity that makes The Social Network a compelling movie The characters live in a dog eat dog world Certain individuals are propelled to the forefront but that success doesn t come without any sacrifice Friendships deteriorate grudges are formed lawsuits are filed and the very legitimacy of Facebook itself is questioned In the end I would have to say that this is one of the year s best films and definitely deserving of an Oscar nod,10

16 November 2010,Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher make a great movie!,David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin come together for what could be this year s bet movie David Fincher has steadily been making a name for himself as on of the the best modern day American directors He has directed the likes of Fight Club Seven and 2007 s criminally underrated masterpiece Zodiac All his movies have been trying to make a commentary on society I don t know whether its a conscious effort but somehow it happens in his movies because of the topic he chooses and the way in which he tries to tell his story He does owe quite a lot to his writers like Andrew Kevin Walker Chuck Palhaniuk and Aaron Sorkin with this movie His movies are well made and there is never a boring moment or tired moment in them Aaron Sorkin has proved himself to be one of the best writers in the business and he has written or co written 66 of the 86 episodes of the West Wing He has this flair for rapid fire interesting dialogue Thai is always saying them Sorkin uses a lot of words but never wastes them He always gets the point across When two minds like this come together even the the biggest Facebook hater will be interested What earlier was touted as a simply a Facebook movie came to be much more when it was given in the talented hands of these two The Social Network is about Mark Zuckerberg s rise to fame and what followed soon after Zuckerberg is portrayed as a more disconnected person than a cold one It is not that he hates people or his friends it is that he simply doesn t need them He loves programming not because he wants to be famous or earn money but it is the only place in the world he finds comfortable where things make sense to him Relationships girlfriends are somehow absent from his life Sometimes we do see him longing for the past when he had a girlfriend when there was a little tenderness in his life But they are few or far between Zuckerberg isn t a terrible person he just seems to be very disconnected Like Mersault s character in the Stranger He is brilliantly played by Jesse Eisenberg who is coming in to his own as an actor I thought he would become more like Cera but he has differentiated himself from Cera and the awkward guy role into something more menacing But all the anger frustration is wonderfully masked and lies just at the surface The Social Network is not being religious to detail fact and accuracy Sorking said as much is in his interview While I do not agree with what he said I believe the movie is a very good one It entertains the viewer it informs him and it also encourages debate and discussion and that is what art should do It observes facts and presents them in a fairly dramatized way but I guess they had to submit to the producers in that sort of way,8

3 October 2011,Why you should and shouldn't see The Social Network,The Story Mark Zuckerberg an abrasive Harvard programming genius without blue blood pedigree dreams of achieving social status in school and beyond To do this he creates what would become the most popular website in the world and he s accused of betrayal several times along the way Is he a backstabber or simply one of the greatest businesspeople of our time The Social Network paints Zuckerberg as neither hero nor villain He s merely obsessed with his mission and paradoxically both a brilliant manipulator of social needs on a broad scale and blind perhaps willfully so to the emotions of those closest to him Eisenberg s performance nearly screams Asperger s but otherwise the film never raises the syndrome as a possibility Being a Sorkin creation this version of Zuckerberg gives us a vicarious thrill in each flash forward deposition during which the powers that be smugly attempt to squash him down and he answers with a crushing unanswerable retort every time However we are never sure if what he is speaking to power is actually truth or what he would like it to be Why you should see it You enjoy a good profound Sorkin speech You re glad to see Eisenberg differentiate himself from Michael Cera although you can t decide whether the two of them playing brothers would be a wonderful idea or a terrible one Why you shouldn t see it You want to finish reading the book first You want to finish reading Facebook first from my review at www 1man365movies com,
2 October 2011,I like this Geekish elements in the film,Now that Facebook has grown to have 500 million active users The movie is about the founder Mark Zuckerberg who has a genius idea to create an innovative Facebook and a human drama from its start up to current glory As you can watch several conversations of Mark Zuckerberg on YouTube and somewhere you may doubt that the portrait of him in this film is a bit exaggerated toward nerd There is undeniable sense that so called a genius hacker is top drawer in mathematics or programming skills but has no skill on communication and the guy who run the world s biggest social network site has simply less social networking skill Geekish elements are spreading out such as unix commands recruit in a hacking competition or Sendmail book is put up in untidy heaps For those people who know something they would like the pieces of scene as well What Napstar was involved in the start up was surprising I just wonder genius gather genius I personally wish this the Social Network will be created much later like the time when Facebook is getting to fade and competitors are trying to eat Facebook within the social network industry then the movie about facebook will be released A theme is about glory and fading,
31 July 2017,wrong movie for the title. it was boring and clichéd,if mr zuck didn t like this movie he should have financed his own and overseen the production starting with the script that probably wouldn t have been any more accurate than this movie was i bet the mediation to make sure ALL the facts of all those involved made it into the movie would take infinitely longer than the real life lawsuits shows in the movie i tried watching it for a movie about facebook you know the social network mentioned in the title it was all about legal disputes so what could have covered all that in about five lines in an epilogue so what about the book it was based on boring book that didn t seem to cover the feel good parts of the happy accidents of the world choosing facebook over the already established yahoo360 friendster and myspace who paved the way for facebook that probably otherwise wouldn t exist mark zuck and co didn t invent social networking as this movie seemingly gives them all the credit for they got lucky why was facebook infinitely more successful than its predecessors is what should have been covered as well it should have also included why no other soc net never tried after mind you twitter instigram and such are doing well but not to the same extent why did the world choose f b over the rest,3
20 May 2020,Fincher's masterpiece.,Looking back in the past decade The Social Network was the one movie I had to settle the score with I have lost count of how many times I have watched it now and every time I watch it the movie gets better and better This is Fincher s best work in terms of critically acclaimed and award winning and I can definitely see why The reason why this movie works so well and it doesn t becomes one of those generic and boring biopics is the tone Fincher creates the whole tone of the film using the cinematography and the score to absolute perfection The way certain scenes are presented the way Fincher uses closeups and the score to elevate the scene is amazing The movie has some of the most dis likeable actors for me Jesse Eisenberg and Justin Timberlake acting in it but I have to say that they do a really good job at keeping up with the level of everyone else involved in this film And you can argue that that s Fincher pushing them to the limits of their potential Now apart of Fincher one of the other reasons this movie works so well is because of the screenplay It feels like you can do no wrong with a screenplay written this well I think that the reason why the viewing experience gets even better each time you watch it it s because of the screenplay There is so much in it given so fast so slick that it s hard to absorb it all in one or two viewings This is a very rare screenplay and Fincher knew it for deviating from his usual genre and do this biopic The script it s so detailed it s slick it s sharp it s smart and witty and I love it Overall it is a fantastic film It s one of those films you can t wait to pass some time so you can watch it again and that is the best compliment I can give to a film,10
25 January 2011,Low-Budget Feel,This film doesn t have the advantages of a documentary because it isn t factual and it does not have the advantages of an entertaining drama because it is directed with all the excitement of a low budget documentary The film would be enjoyed just as thoroughly as an audio file No visuals Because there is nothing to see If the subject matter were not centered on an institution everyone cares so much about this movie would never have made it to a second showing on the big screen This is one of those few times one wishes there were no minimal word requirement to these reviews Some films are simply not worth the energy,4
20 June 2022,BRILLIANT,This movie still holds up years later Personally the entire cast should ve won all the acting awards And how was Garfield not nominated for an Oscar It truly baffles me,10
4 November 2011,"Smooth, smart yet shallow",This movie deserved the accolades thrown on it With a good script penned by Aaron Sorkin who breaks out of the habits that killed his previous show nice pacing smart acting and a few clever tricks it tells the story of Facebook in convincing fashion Proceedings are kept lean and smart there are not too many characters and they are kept relatively uncomplicated In fact that might be the main criticism for something dressed as a factual interpretation of events it s all rather shallow The main character has the most depth but the rest more or less tumble into the situations they were designed for In short it lines up a lot of caricatures of people and them shoots them down in appropriate fashion Near the end a character makes a comment that counters one of the opening lines in the movie it s intentional and works if you don t think too much about it But under close scrutiny it falls apart That is the trick to this move don t think too hard and it appears to be intelligent But dig too deep and the whole saga seems a tad daft Much like Facebook,
24 June 2018,The film is good,Social net work is about Facebook but not the company it s mainly about these two character Mark and Eduardo the friend ship and conflict are great and you really buy Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg at least in this movie I have no idea what kind of person is Mark Zuckerberg but in this movie Jesse is Zuckerberg i really don t think there is much flaw in these movie i mean it is based on true events The story is amazing I love the way they tell the story through flash backs if you even can call them flash backs It is very interesting that they over shadow the story with the reading of the law sue Most of the time you will get bored or annoyed but the exposition and this movie is basically full of that it haves to be but the movie it s not boring My greatest concern before i watch these movie that is this movie going to be boring as hell you expect this movie to be full of dialog and scenes that just two characters with close up cut to another cut but it is not I think they change the characteristics of Mark Zuckerberg from real life not completely different but different enough to makes this character interesting because they have a very interesting story in hand all they need is interesting characters When they have dialog the way they to keep us audiences interesting is to constantly change locations and scenario Every time they give out important plot information the scene is different the location the relation between the characters the situation sound in the back ground it keeps the scene fresh enough for the viewers invested But yet again this movie is all about exposition and there is really not much they can do about it even it s entertaining and the scenes are fleshed out it still gets a bit bored from time to time it s not at a point that is bad it s just a little flaw of the movie that the creators really can t do about it i really think they make the best out of it every second of them hacking is extremely entertaining from cuts to cuts sound design and the lighting it is just beautiful I said it before this movie is all about the character and they really did fleshed out these two characters Everything that happened you buy it you believe it not because it is real it s because of you believe these characters would do such action And i have to say the performance is amazing there is just one thing i like to point out mainly because of the actor Jesse Eisenberg he always do this most of the characters he play they all tend to talk really fast it s not out of the character but after seeing some movies he talks fast all the time I don t know why but it s not wrong at least in this movie The clash of these two character seems so natural the build up of the conflict and distance starts early all the way to the climax of the movie and the impact was extremely powerful And there are a lot of smart film making and writing In conclusion this movie is beautifully shot and characters are great the story is great you can actually feel something after seeing this movie unlike most films today so I recommend people watch this movie,8
18 December 2018,Recommended if you like dramas with comedy elements and are interested in Zuckerbergs story,Finally came around to watching the most popular movie about mr Zuckerberg and the founding of his little website The film opens with Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg at Harvard University in 2003 Mark was just dumped by his girlfriend Erica Rooney Mara for being a jerk His reaction to this is to post insulting things about her on his blog while simultaneously hacking the University database to illegally download pictures of all the female members and drinking lots of beers With the help of his best friend Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield he uses the downloaded pictures to create the website Facemash which ranks two girls and the user picks the hottest which is so popular that in a short time it crashes the whole University computer network The University is not pleased but Mark s website did draw the attention of three Harvard upper class members Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and their business partner Divya Narendra who have an idea for a social network featuring exclusive Harvard members and aimed at dating They ask if Mark likes to join their project as a programmer Mark agrees to work on their project but then starts to create his own online social network called thefacebook funded with the help of Eduardo and leaves the Narendra and the Winklevoss brothers in the dark of what he is really doing When he launches thefacebook website it immediately becomes a success which infuriates the Winklevoss brothers who blame him for stealing their idea Things get more and more tense when thefacebook grows and Mark draws the attention of playboy and Napster founder Sean Parker Justin Timberlake who would like to work with him and make it a billion dollar project Overall this is a good movie I really liked the chemistry between the main characters Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield who stole the movie for me and it s story kept me watching even though you already know what happens I guess everybody knows what Facebook is during this day and age The supporting cast did a fine job as well and I was surprised by the performance of Justin Timberlake or was he just acting as himself The message of the movie is clear the young techs are coming and it leaves it to the viewer to make up your mind about Zuckerberg true intentions What bugged me the most in this movie is that they portrayed Zuckerberg as a lonely nerd and that he was still lovesick about some girl he dated years ago The real Zuckerberg was in a relationship during the time this movie takes place and he married his girlfriend in 2012 which is a huge difference with the Zuckerberg we see in the movie It s also interesting that they tell the story in a flashback style with the courtroom being the present time but it s sometime a little bit difficult to follow what event happened first But despite this it s a fine movie with good acting some comedy moments and an interesting story about how one of the biggest websites ever was founded Check out this film if you like dramas with some comedy elements and are interested in Zuckerbergs story and the rise of Facebook But don t expect it to be 100 accurate as is usual in biography s,7
20 October 2022,Great!,Fast paced and interesting this movie tries too hard to portray Zuckenberg in a better light than he deserves He was not a good coder He was much more exploitative than movie suggest as his later love affair with CIA and selling personal data of facebook users for nefarious purposes proved This guy is far less charismatic than portrayed and he isn t portrayed as particularly charismatic to begin with and far more calculating menacing and Machiavelian than described The only thing the movie did show worse than it was was Zuckenberg incel situation Zuckenberg was dating a Chinese golddigger smartdigger Harvarddigger the whole time and they got married But despite being more positive towards its subject than they would warrant the movie manages to capture part of the psychopathic nature of facebook and its founding Artistic liberties were taken in order to humanize these monsters to make us care and for plot not to be boring In that it succeeded but humanizing monsters like Zuckenberg or Hitttlerr is never a good idea in a movie However you at least get an idea about the depths of the cutthrooat depravity that was only confirmed by the fact that facebook abuses the trust of its sheeple all the time and a movie is fun to watch and deserves a praise even if it is an idealised sanitized overseksed version of the sorry reality this movie is based on and as a movie is well worth a watch but keep in mind the reality was much darker and more boring at the same time,8
29 October 2010,Far from Fincher's best,I have to agree with one of the other reviews here if Facebook were not so popular there would not be so much credit given to this film Its far from Zodiac or Seven Fincher s best films by far This is competent film making from Fincher and no more It is him going through the motions of what he s done before He s not pushing or using his craft as he has done in the past Also the dialogue while clever fast paced and self aware means that all characters sound the same its more about showing off with dialogue than being true to the characters or story I was soooooo looking forward to this and was really disappointed,
17 November 2010,"Irrespective of how genuine the story is, it makes one good film, worthy a watch in the theater.",I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,8
25 April 2011,Was it worth the Hype?,I faced viewing this film for the first time with a lot of doubt and trepidation The plot and story did not fill me with an overwhelming anticipation or real desire to watch it I just wanted to see what the fuss was about However I was very pleasantly surprised to find I really enjoyed it and found the whole theme riveting and the move experience extremely enjoyable It was superbly directed and well acted with a storyline that grabbed attention throughout All the main characters were absolute horrific and people who I would steer well clear from but that is what is so good about the film is that it is so believable You didn t care who won or lost In fact you wanted them all to lose But it was so riveting that you wanted to know what happened It was a pleasant surprise but i should not have doubted the man who thrilled me with Zodiac and Seven A modern classic enjoy,8
10 July 2021,reflecting,As part of university students it s not hard to for me to find new creations new patents therefore new business conflicts But it s the outstanding mark zukerburg that makes it to the top level The originality of rating hot girls or even connecting people through mutuals is just as reckless yet tremendously memorable The world always has different judging systems towards the weirdos also the most talented kind as we discover through their wisdom and amazed by their talent it s also cruel that they would cut u off any business important moments because their mind is driven not by sentiment but by pure rationality,5
13 March 2019,Andrew Garfield steals the show!,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,8
12 March 2018,Hollywoods Poke at Mark Zuckerberg,I was at sixes and severs with this movie on one hand I applauded the scripted dialogue of Mark Zuckerberg in its wit and intelligence and its mockery of the most banal interaction sand observations we pass for conversation and on the other it shows the most disgusting abuse of trust and portrays a picture of such a despicable unlikable insecure backstabbing coward who we heralded as a modern day hero and someone to admire If this superb depiction is even remotely close or as close as Hollywood permits to reality then he should be an object of ridicule and derision and instead is the youngest self made billionaire in history,7
5 June 2022,Eduardo's necessary redemption,It s always interesting getting to know the bibliography of famous people and what makes it even better this time it s that we re talking about Facebook story all about that young multimillionaire I loved the actors and the plot 8 out of 10,8
15 November 2010,A masterfully understated modern saga.,Firstly I thoroughly enjoyed The Social Network The acting is fantastic the direction and score pleasantly understated and the whole package wrapped up nicely as a biopic cum rise and fall saga Special mention must go to Jesse Eisenberg for an absorbing performance that manages to make the most of Aaron Sorkin s lightning fast script The wicked humour of the early stages of the film mellows towards the end as we start to empathise with almost all of the characters So what s wrong with it I found the film to be almost a little too quirky a little twee The characters of Zuckerberg Parker and the Winklevi seem heightened a little too exaggerated to be fully believable Part of this is in the dialogue which is clever but a little too perfect for characters who are all struggling to make themselves understood Part of it is in the occasional flashes of artsy music and camera work as if Fincher is trying to distance the film from the Hollywood pantheon Maybe it is because by the end of the film I still wasn t really sure what the message was or what the characters had learned But maybe that s the point We may never understand what goes on inside Zuckerberg s head but we are absorbed by watching how it plays out The intelligence that sets him apart also keeps him apart and his fierce individuality set up the emotional strain that follows While it may not quite have rung true The Social Network is a very good film all the more interesting given that Facebook is still gaining followers and taking up more and more of our collective free time A final note Justin Timberlake s decision to take up acting is the best career move since Joachim Phoenix decided to stop rapping A very talented man,9
18 February 2011,Best Comedy/Horror of the year: Wakeup Hollywood,I am not sure where the Hollywood is heading I pray and hope this film though already nominated for Oscar shouldn t win if Oscar judges give this film the best film award then GOD bless Hollywood they cant go anything lower than this in worst Hollywood cinema They already start heading down south in making movies I wont believe when it won the golden globe and I bet this movie won because it was lobbied like our senates First of all 2003 showed in the movie like 1940 s so If any sane person and those who are raving about this movie giving some 8 stars and above I request them to go and watch Beautiful Mind Even that movie was not brilliant due to the fact that the events were manipulated but at least it was story about noble price winner mathematician not some crappy cheat guy But this is a movie about a douchebag and of course director got undisclosed amount of money from facebook founder douchebag Mark He almost made us to believe that he was a good guy but in reality he was the biggest douchebag and looser who did not invent anything except steal the idea and modify with his own crap and put it for the world and pass it like he is the inventor Not only that he betrayed his only and real good friend he ditch everyone around him The director showed that video piracy audio piracy illegal download of music stealing ideas and everything is fine I guess how would he feels if this films watch on pirated DVD s and he has to bear the loses This is the high time Hollywood should wake up and start looking for real Cinema there was the biggest conspiracy for Inception because it was brilliant movie but since its against the very own set of rules of Oscar judges and it wasn t made by or about any body like Mark so they don t give Inception enough credit or put Leonardo DiCaprio for best actor for this movie What make them give Jesse Eisenberg a best actor nomination I don t understand what all he did in the movie was looking like nerd by wearing dirty hoodies and blank face no emotions and nothing to act about I don t think a real Harvard dress like that I guess people should start watching real cinema of 50 s and 60 s to get to know the quality of work Hollywood used to produce and compare with today s crap they are making to know the difference,2
23 April 2011,Welcome to Face Book,The Social Network works on so many levels making it one of the best if not the best movie of 2010 This movie is about so many things but mostly about Face book and the man who started it This is David Fincher best film to date and he is probably on of the finest directors working in Hollywood today The movie is not laid out in linear fashion but told through a series of flashbacks The movie starts with Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg trying to impress a young woman but comes across as a complete jerk He has a web page Face Match but soon gets in trouble with Harvard s IT department for breaking into their systems At this point some rich students with their idea of a social network for Harvard students gets in touch with him and he agrees to help them develop their web page He takes some of their idea and develops his own web page that will become Face Book This will cause friction and a law suit which drives the story In the meantime Mark needs cash to develop the software so he goes to his friend Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield for some cash and makes him CFO of the business Well the site takes off and eventually he meets up with Sean Parker Justin Timberlake who in a way help mentor Mark and help himself along the way He causes friction between Mark and Eduardo and the rest is history This movie is about Face Book but also about relationships loyalty hero worship the viral nature of the internet and the business of internet All actors give really great performances which makes this a most enjoyable movies Grade A,10
18 October 2010,A Social Event,I first learned of Jesse Eisenberg watching The Squid and the Whale a few years ago and it wasn t just the movie that blew me away but the sheer screen presence of this self assured young actor Since then he dazzled me in among other films The Education of Charlie Banks Adventureland Zombieland and he was a welcome participant in minor projects like Cursed and The Hunting Party All that said his depiction of Mark Zuckerberg the socially awkward computer genius who created guess what internet behemoth is simply incredible and I am thinking Oscar nomination which of course will not happen since Mr Eisenberg hasn t even reached 30 yet and hopefully has a long and prosperous career still in front of him But wait there s more Andrew Garfield is impressive as Eduardo Saverin dodging the clich s of a role that could have easily drifted into self pity Justin Timberlake shamelessly steals every scene he s in and hats off to Armie Hammer who plays both Cameron Winklevoss and his twin brother Tyler with natural ease which is no small feat considering he had to play off himself I have no idea how David Fincher did it all I can tell you is I didn t waste a single thought whether there was one or two actors in front of the camera Which brings me to the main masterminds Fincher and wordsmith extra ordinaire Aaron Sorkin The big question was after The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is there any way Fincher can top this Well there isn t but together with Sorkin who at his core is a playwrite he was able to maintain the high level of quality entertainment you ve come to expect from this director I don t give a damn how much of the story is fiction or how little of it is fact all I know is this two hours movie went by in a blink without a single dull moment and that might as well be the biggest compliment I can pay a film in general and The Social Network in particular,10
4 October 2010,"Run, don't walk, to see this movie!",I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,10
19 November 2010,To see!,It was a very interesting title about a teen s life instead of the history of a sensational creation which really will upset the world Director David Fincher shows all principal character feelings and his matter to consider each situation by the point of view not only a young boy but also of a genius Neither a minute of boring in this fluent movie that consecrates Jesse Eisenberg as a striking actor how he yet had demonstrated in The village and Fincher as one of the most capable contemporary directors who was my favourite but after his two last movies I had found him in trouble for me this title is his redemption Absolutely to see,9
30 January 2018,A Stunning History of Facebook,While this may not be 100 acccurate to what Mark Zcukerberg says happened its still a thrill By the end you realize you re cheering for the bad guy and yet you feel like you can really realte to the stuggles of owning your own ideas Easily in the top 20 of the 21st century,9
22 April 2020,A cinematic masterpiece,From the very first scene I could tell this film was going to be something special Dialogues are well written and they are delivered in the most orderly way that there were times which made me stop for a few seconds and appreciate the screenplay of Aaron Sorkin after some lines uttered by Mark Even though the story tells how one of the most famous social networking sites of today was founded it s told in the most chilling and inspirational way possible that I started to listen to Hand Covers Bruise the intro soundtrack whenever I m working on something and need motivation Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield have a really good on screen chemistry that two different characters with very contrasting emotional ranges give the most emotionally profound friendship story David Fincher s cinematography and Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross soundtracks make the film a cinematic masterpiece,10
19 December 2010,ironic,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,9
3 April 2020,Much better than you would expect,It takes skill to make something so boring so dramatic This is about the making of Facebook but it feels like some mafia movie The visuals and soundtrack as well as acting all make this a very interesting and captivating film,8
16 October 2021,Excellent,What should I tells you about this movie We all know about Facebook We know Maek Zukerbug Just we don t know how he creates this facebook How many people work on that When you forget your friend s help and his work you should be a helpless person in the world When mark invented facebook where he find this idea How he made it This movie tells us how Facebook start Truly I am angry on the mark Because he is a selfish man When we find a true friend how we cheated him Our concise firstly fight with the mind Why we do this But this movie is amazing Truly I have enjoyed it,9
4 March 2019,Excellent!,This is one of the few movies that I can keep coming back to When it starts out we see Mark with his girlfriend She basically breaks up with him We see him and his friends at Harvard and soon after he starts developing Facebook The movie cuts between a meeting with his lawyer and those suing him to the events leading up to Facebook I found it fascinating They made it so dramatic and draw you into the story Definitely recommended 10 10,10
27 June 2011,"Not What I Expected, but in the Best Possible Way",When I first heard the concept for The Social Network I rolled my eyes The Facebook Movie is what they were calling it and what many are still calling it a nickname that gives the impression that this is nothing more than Hollywood cashing in on a fad I mean really a movie about facebook What a joke However this is not The Facebook Movie sure there may be a bit of cashing in on a fad but that s mostly just being cynical What this movie is is a well written beautifully shot film featuring great performances and led by wonderful direction from David Fincher The film tells the story of Mark Zuckerberg and the process he went through creating and eventually defending facebook The film jumps back and forth between two time lines and does a great job building suspense by showing you the consequences of actions that you aren t yet aware of There s no real twist to the movie but the film constantly keeps you guessing by referring to events that haven t been revealed to the audience yet through the structure of the narrative Fincher and Aaron Sorkin the writer did a fantastic job putting this film together both the writing and the direction are impeccable and they are able to tell the story at a mile a minute without leaving the audience confused in the wake of the rapid fire dialogue and the abrupt changes of time line There was some great cinematography in the film utilizing dynamic use of focus to center in on what s really important to the moment and even using some trick photography techniques like tilt shift While everything is set in the real world in close to present day the film has a distinct visual style because of it s use of photography Also I have to mention that the acting was great as well Every character felt completely natural in their roles and while dialogue was a big part of the film the subtleties of facial expression and physical acting were not forgotten I can t pick out just one performance that stood out because they were all great but Andrew Garfield Jesse Eisenberg and Justin Timberlake shine the most because they had the most prominent roles My only complaints with the film are minor we all know that sex drugs and alcohol are part of the stereotypical college image but in a way I think that making the party image so prominent in this story it may have taken away from some of the grounded reality of the film and even lessened the impact of certain scenes near the end Also for once I want to see a movie based on true events not conform to the clich of using and they went on to paragraphs of text at the end of the film to wrap up the loose ends We payed to see a movie so if it s important enough to the story to mention show us don t tell us otherwise we re perfectly capable of reading the Wikipedia page ourselves The Social Network was one of the better movies this year that s not a great honor considering there haven t been that many great movies to choose from so far this year but the movie was good regardless There s nothing terribly groundbreaking and if you look back in a few years on the films that came out in 2010 you re much more likely to remember Toy Story 3 or Inception than this but despite that it s still a good movie with great performances great writing and a great cast Definitely worth going to see besides it s not like anything else good is coming out in October Rating A,10
24 December 2010,jusco's review: The Social Network,Many would probably agree with me that upon hearing David Fincher was directing a Facebook film there were two general reactions 1 a Facebook film are you kidding me 2 David Fincher and Facebook shouldn t it be David Fincher and provoking thrillers like Seven or Fight Club or Zodiac Well Mr Fincher you have officially and successfully pulled it off and we re more than willing to shut up now This is a film based on the founding of the Internet social networking phenomenon site Facebook which I highly doubt needs an explanation unless you re one of the rare few not in the overwhelming 500 million who has an account But please be aware this is far from factual If you re looking for a faithful documentary or biographical film that portrays the humble beginnings of the website and the eventual lawsuits over the disputes about who actually owned the shares you re looking in the wrong place But if you re looking for a film that is intelligent and witty you re in the right place I emphasise again that this is a smart film In fact probably much smarter than what most people are used to but the genius of the film is how it is able to effectively bring us along with the fast paced turn of events without confusing the audience It contains brilliant dialogue that must be attributed to Aaron Sorkin the scriptwriter From the first scene you are already thrown into a world of highly astute and quick witted conversations But then again this is Harvard can you expect otherwise Apparently Jesse Eisenberg s portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg was far from accurate the real life Mark Zuckerberg is known to be quiet and reserved But this can be easily overlooked for Jesse Eisenberg s execution is in perfect style quick thinking witty and though at times irritating eventually wins the audience over to symphathise with him Andrew Garfield had a relatively easy character to play Eduardo Saverin the rich businessman who supports Mark but eventually sues him But Justin Timberlake I had no idea he could act so well was the standout His character Sean Parker the founder of Napster is so charming to the point of annoying and he played his role very cleverly This film does make you think about the constantly evolving world of technology that is currently dominating our lives It causes you to question the issue of privacy the issue of morality and the issue of Virtual vs Reality How many profiles portrayed on Facebook are similar to the person in reality How different How can this type of social networking site benefit us or even harm us Is our society too reliant on said site or is it a perfectly harmless way to interact and socialise to make new friends and acquaintances Just a few questions to think about The Social Network has been described as a cinematic masterpiece That it is,9
14 January 2017,No one said superiority would be easy,The single minded determination demonstrated by the main character is a wonderful example of what it takes to achieve revolutionary creations Ignoring lesser minds is simply a matter of turning the volume of your mind down when dealing with the ideas and opinions of the fear based rigid masses Zuckerberg reminds me of Jobs They both just steamroll past the weakness of others The scene where MZ verbally slaps and experienced lawyer is brilliant It takes a lot of courage to go toe to toe with older generations when you have been conditioned to believe that they deserve respect Respect is earned MZ has mine If you study either MZ or Jobs and find them arrogant and selfish it is safe to categorize yourself as food for the wolves Fear not Good company is found in the herd,9
26 December 2010,A classic.,In these days of special effects and parallel realities this movie shines like a rare jewel No fantasy worlds no bullets no explosions just old fashioned feelings Human beings facing life making choices and coping with the consequences And facebook Oh it s a minor detail The mcguffin as Hitchock would call it This movie is not about facebook strictly speaking It s about self identity friendship values Sounds weary But of course this story has been told so many times That s why this movie is great It s so good to see that some people out there still believe that what counts is not the story but how you tell it It s a fact there is no new story No matter how much make up you put on it blue like in Avatar or dreamy like in Inception every story is an old one So you better get an amazing script to tell yours and you might want to have some solid acting too and of course a serious editor and some cool music And there you go you have a classic,9
8 March 2011,Good,Half points taken because I HATE it when someone takes a real story and changes things If you take a real story then tell it like it is or change all the names of those supposed to be real people Congratulations on such a wonderful handsome boys collection A candy for all the girls eyes Basically it was an enjoyable movie mostly because of this Good story telling funny Justin Timberlake surprised me nice acting Jesse Eisenberg did a great job the character was very entertaining to watch Andrew Garfield s character was so damn cute and adorable lol I guess the movie is in favor of Eduardo But you need to have a mood for this because I was watching the movie in 3 days Only the 3rd day I began valuing it and enjoying it My first reaction was to quit facebook because the owner is an a h but they made him so for a movie that s annoying,5
16 June 2020,A Masterpiece,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,8
2 November 2010,The Social Network - lol?,A disappointing film from a talented director But hey everyone flops once in a while right A watchable spectacle of cinema but ultimately nothing that gets the blood pumping heart racing or brain ticking like Fight Club Se7en or The Game the latter being this blogger s personal favourite When a movie s best acting performance comes from yours truly Justin Timberlake who I m pretty sure just walked off the set of Bringin sexy back you ve got serious issues No soundtrack to remember All great films have a great soundtrack this movie had neither I can assure you of that The Social Network lol,6
26 December 2010,Three cheers for The Social Network,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,10
23 September 2010,A Good film by a Great Director,Going into this film I thought it would be about a guy making a website People then claiming that the website he made was there s and from that point it was going to be a he said she said type ordeal No it was much more complex than that While a lot of people took sides Team Zuckerberg vs Team Vinklevoss sorry for the twilight reference joke the character development and acting were fantastic and really made this movie enjoyable Fincher did a great job with the progression of the film Jesse Eisenberg did great and his counterpart Andrew Garfield did great as well the tension between these two during the film was great due to there conflict of interests on what to do about facebook The progression of both Zuckerbergs life and Saverin Garfields character lives throughout the popularity and trial phases of there lives were spot on As for people mentioning Oscar buzz you are correct this film should grab some nominations 8 10 stars,1
8 March 2011,"Money, genius, asshole, attitude and betrayal",Money and wealth No spiritual things are mentioned here We only talk about the Material What is money and what is wealth You spend one hour write a program and sell it to Microsoft Then you get 1000 and buy your girlfriend a coat That s wealth Studentship or the money that our parents support is far from called wealth until you know how to use it to make more In the movie Mark and Eduardo are rich But for the twin Winklevoss I have to say that they are not rich enough Talent excitation Everybody has the potential to become a genius However a so called genius must be stimulated which makes the genius population limited Provocation from his girl is the original motivation to start the facebook Challenging tasks in programming may help Mark forget the unhappiness at the same time Actually real excitation is very hard to get because you have to obtain a woman you care and a project you like Asshole s logic Mark is called asshole because he is incredibly meticulous and nerdy Everything in his eyes has to be precise and correct just like Binary During the foundation of facebook I think Mark understands very well how much stake each of them Eduardo Sean and himself should hold In Mark s opinion Eduardo has to pay for his mistake If we say that the freezing of accounts is excusable due to Mark s behavior which made Eduardo has unfair treatment feeling then the praise I love talking to people who understand finance went to his head which makes it obvious that he was careless Therefore Eduardo should not get 30 stake in Mark s point of view But will it be only 0 3 We don t know Attitude and power A very interesting phenomenon is that in China when you drink with your friend although both of you do not want to get drunk you all do finally Sometimes people are living for a kind of feeling for example feeling balance and fair Unless you are as nerdy as Mark is you always have to show some attitude although it seems to be meaningless That s why we saw Harvard gentlemen and I just want to get my things back in the movie Betrayal and Self harm Are Mark and Eduardo friends This is just like asking whether Mark and Erica are lovers Different people have different way to express their emotions There was a very talented and pretty poetess Lin Daiyu in Chinese fiction who liked get together but she actually did not enjoy it because before get together she always worried her friends leaving She could not endure this feeling as a result she said she hated get together and never wanted it Maybe Mark values friendship very much but simultaneously he fears his friend one day will betray him Mark would rather hurt his best friend in case of one day s probable betrayal which is kind of helpless protection But who will be hurt more He keeps doing this and falls in love with this self harm feeling gradually Does he remember once he said to Eduardo WE did it You re not an asshole Mark You are just trying so hard to be At the end of movie Mark refreshes the web page over and over again In fact he is hurt seriously more than Eduardo and more than Erica Although he has got to 500 million friends with only a few enemies the biggest enemy is himself ironically You can say he is poor you can sigh he is tragic But after all he asked for it he does not even dare to imagine his girl will come back Instead he is enjoying her rejection from time to time like drugs,10
12 April 2011,Justin Timberlake CANNOT act,The Social Network wasn t bad but I definitely don t get the hype At all OK interesting story very well acted by Eisenberg with some pretty impressive supporting cast Enter Timberlake who plays the douche y guy trying to weasel his way into something that wasn t his all too well because it s not really acting it s what he does in this film He s a blatant error throughout the whole film Frankly he doesn t deserve to be in the company of the actors and I d be insulted to have to share time with him simply because he sang in NSync and dated Britany Spears It was a good movie It kept your attention for the two hours so I give it credit But I definitely don t feel the hype,6
11 January 2017,Great film progression,I think that its a great movie because I like how the story progresses and how the film is shot However I personally believe that the film s depiction of the characters are definitely an exaggeration to their real life situations making it a little more of a fiction rather than an actual biography which didn t really do the job of flabbergasting me in the way films based on real life people are supposed to This drama film also has a pretty decent sense of humour adding a tinge of comedy into it I guess I just really enjoy the formality of this movie The twins in the movie played by Armie Hammer are too good looking,
5 November 2010,Good but didn't learn much...,This film was one that I automatically didn t like before I even watched it The idea of making a film out of a very well known and recent event seems like a Director comp out and doesn t have any real substance After seeing the film I was wrong The Social Network really wasn t an amazing movie but gave some very interesting insight on how TheFaceBook com came to being The movie was very anti Mark Zuckerberg and did portray him as stealing the idea and basically selling out his best friend Altogether the movie was entertaining but reminded me of Notorious due to the fact that after watching both movies I really didn t learn anything that I didn t know before Rating B video game Hollywood com,8
19 December 2021,A character fall arc every GenZ should watch...,Fincher and Sorkin create a tight engaging story and at the end of it leave it to the viewer to decide the winner Jesse Eisenberg aces the role of tech tycoon Mark Zuckerberg and Andrew Garfield does a great job at portraying the emotional friend Edwardo,9
26 January 2022,The Social Network,1 An absolute stinker of a film with no redeeming features It s unlikely that any film will receive this score 2 Oh not great at all Amongst the worst films ever made 3 I won t be back and am less than pleased I ve just spent time watching this 4 Very poor effort Struggled through 5 Mediocre Nothing special at all but not completely unbearable 6 Tries hard On its way to worthwhile 7 Solid viewing Can t complain would recommend 8 Cracking Enjoyed immensely But it takes a lot to get 9 9 It takes a lot to get 9 10 An absolute banger of a film Couldn t be better It s unlikely that any film will receive this score,10
17 April 2011,The genius unleashed and the dark evolution of the largest social network,Could not catch this on the theater but got a DVD from a friend of mine and watched it yesterday The best part is that it talks about a subject that is very fresh and contemporary Its not difficult to relate to And this movie throws light into the dark evolution of the social network Was it the case of plain and superlative genius or was it the technical excellence coupled with the ability to stand over the shoulders of the giants Whatever it is this is an unexplored side of a large social mesh that has connected us all To see it evolve from an idea the people who carried it and how it has threaded the entire world and tied them together under one roof is a thrilling journey Don t miss your ticket to this one,6
24 March 2015,Facebook for Dummies,At some point in the movie I smiled and thought I wasn t going to hate The Social Network At that moment I had the rating at 7 stars It s down to 6 because I found the manipulative herding by the movie annoying As things got more mundane and people got richer the story was about making Sean Parker the bad guy and Mark Zuckerberg not a good guy but someone trying hard to be an a hole Rashida Jones character tells us what to take away from the movie and that s not cool In the beginning I thought being exposed to Zuckerberg s mouthpiece and seeing the inner workings of Harvard was going to be intimidating Zuckerberg seems to disappear from his own movie after some time The power politics of Harvard were glossed over For the success story of the youngest billionaire currently there was not much debauchery on show Now I m not someone who watches movies for the sex scenes I think not one sex scene looks credible hot or believable in films but not one aspect of the film is focused on The blame for this lies firmly at the director s door Give me something to remember the movie to make it stand out from other sometimes better ones Where s the guy who directed Se7en Now I don t use facebook I m intimidated by the games online and I m disappointed by the interface whenever I happen to view a facebook home page I didn t know who the founder of the company was before this film came out The film s best asset was trying to make things ambiguous It s a vehicular product that does not inspire me to write a good review of it You know what having rethought about what I ve seen I ll just downgrade the rating to a 5 Sorry for the awful review Ta,5
18 August 2022,Very Good,I don t know why but I love this movie The direction is great and the actors also The film about Mark Zuckerberg is perfect I would recommend this film to everyone,10

3 October 2010,Best Film of the Year,We live in a country where nearly half of the population has a Facebook account over 125million users in the United States alone Facebook is a large part of the way we interact in our increasingly digitally connected world Facebook pages by their very nature are not necessarily accurate representations of who we are but rather venues to display whom we often wish we were Who could be so consumed by this idea of showing the world who he wanted to be that he would not only create a website but a virtual empire where he can finally prove his worth read my full review at my brand new blog and please feel free to follow and comment at http nickle eye blogspot com,10
23 October 2021,Great,Everything about the movie is great the pacing was spontaneous the writing was done masterfully by Aaron Sorkin and it was well directed by David Fincher The film is a masterpiece,10
25 October 2010,Superlative!,When I saw the preview for this movie I just rolled my eyes and didn t want to see it But the buzz surrounding it was so positive I had to see it and it blew me away The first thing that surprised me was Jesse Eisenberg who I hadn t seen in a movie before I just assumed he was another Michael Cera but his performance as Mark Zuckerberg is unlike anything I ve seen before Andrew Garfield also blew me away as Eduardo Saverin The script is ridiculously good full of one liners and zingers Zuckerberg doesn t finish the movie looking very good but through a combination of his witty lines and Eisenberg s performance I still ended up loving the guy The movie is long but doesn t feel long It s sort like a biopic of Facebook but it doesn t feel long or predictable like a lot of biopics I highly recommend it for anyone who likes movies,10
14 November 2010,Go & see this movie!,Different people like different things How amazing would it be if you created a product that would be exactly what each individual using it wanted it to be How great would it be to find a uniquely common theme by which to market it AND have other people market it for you free of charge That s exactly what Mark Zuckerberg has created Genius sorry love or hate his personality one must acknowledge the genius of what he s created The Social Network is a movie about Zuckerberg s story how Facebook was created I would however suggest taking the accuracy of the story line with a pinch of salt except for Zuckerberg s clothes he testifies to the their accuracy in a Y combinator interview It is rare that I have an experience in a cinema where I am excited throughout and at the end the audience applauded rightly so If you have a vision for your business you must go and see this movie I dare you not to be inspired by it If you want to be entertained go and see this movie If you want to be excited about possibilities that lie before you lie before us all Go and see this movie If you like a good belly laugh go and see this movie If you appreciate an awesomely crafted movie go and see this movie To summarise go and see this movie,9
7 November 2014,excellently directed and acted out film!,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,8
18 July 2011,A Class Above,Subtly and slyly David Fincher turns to address head on a theme which has only been tangentially hinted at in his previous movies the American social and power elite Fincher turns his attention to a depiction of the intellectual and social elites that attend such schools as Phillips Exeter and move onto attend Ivy League universities such as Harvard where the action takes place Seemingly a story about the founding of a website this movie is also a blackly comic look at the most privileged section of US society during their formative student years before they go onto enter politics and business at the highest level It is an excellent depiction of the Facebook creation myth in that it is very funny and quite gripping and it takes skill to make a story such as this either funny or gripping Hats off to those involved in making this movie it is an entertaining treat Here we encounter the angst ridden but aggressively acerbic IT genius Mark Zuckerberg who founded Facebook and his clashes with friends and rivals who wish to claim the invention of Facebook as their own Fincher and Sorkin portray Zuckerberg as an outsider insurgent motivated by resentment at exclusion from a hierarchy within a hierarchy represented by exclusive fraternal societies at Harvard such as the Phenix Club Compliments must go to Aaron Sorkin the scriptwriter along with Fincher for this absorbing and sometimes outright hilarious portrayal of competing ambitions in the intellectual dog eat dog hot house of Harvard Here students are portrayed as already self consciously worrying about what mark they will make on society before even graduating let alone accepting their first seat on the board of a Fortune 500 company Armand Hammer his own casting a worthy joke in itself steals the movie in the role of the Winklevoss twins who claimed they were owed a slice of The Facebook equity but he has stiff competition from none other than Justin Timberlake who gives a powerful and smart in its restraint performance as Sean Parker of Napster fame Fincher s interest in the entrenched dynastic social networks of wealth and privilege which rule America despite one of the culture s strongest myths being that it is a classless society could be glimpsed tangentially in previous movies The representations of institutional politics big business and the legal system in Seven and The Game were not centre stage although the placing of Jodie Foster s character in Panic Room among the social elite of Manhattan was a clearer marker of where Fincher s real interest might lie In these cynical and post political times it might be thought redundant or even ludicrous to describe this movie as subversive or to even think that subversion was Sorkin and Fincher s aim The movie merely portrays in a scathingly funny way a part of the American social fabric which is normally either invisible to most people or whose very existence is denied the American aristocracy A great movie Fincher s last movie Benjamin Button was an adaptation of an F Scott Fitzgerald short story and the influence of Fitzgerald is all over this movie too Mark Zuckerberg as a Gatsby for the 21st Century The biggest joke of all of course is the alleged valuation of Facebook but that is a different movie,9
14 October 2010,An engaging and provocative drama that may just make you think twice before you update your Facebook status in the future,At the end of the millennium David Fincher s visceral take on Chuck Palahniuk s novel Fight Club defined a generation and while it seems like only yesterday that it was released eleven years have passed since Brad Pitt and Edward Norton contributed towards what is now regarded as a cult classic Over a decade later the revered director has once more attempted to capture a moment in time bravely deciding to focus his efforts on real events from very recent history by filming a compelling drama based entirely on the creation of a single website that quickly became a worldwide phenomenon Jesse Eisenberg plays Marc Zuckerberg the brains behind Facebook and The Social Network opens with a snappy dialogue between Zuckerberg and a female companion that ends disastrously allowing the audience to fully comprehend the social awkwardness surrounding the film s lead and his motivation for the creation of his website Assisted by a number of friends most notably Andrew Garfield in a stunning performance that is reassuring to fans of Spiderman Garfield is scheduled to play Peter Parker in the upcoming reboot Zuckerberg utilises his computer skills to create an exclusive club for Harvard students that remains accessible to the less sporty members of the prestigious University In doing so he unwittingly unleashes a social medium that begins to spread across America and eventually over to Europe as more and more students become obsessed with their online presence and the ability to check up on their friends and more importantly their relationship statuses wherever they are in the world There is no denying that The Social Network tells an incredible story with Fincher s visual flair perfectly matched with the powerful soundtrack by Trent Reznor especially in a standout rowing scene that is guaranteed to get your heartbeat racing but the only downside is a lacklustre ending which cannot really be levelled as a criticism after all this is real life and the story will continue long after the credits are rolling People familiar with Facebook will find a lot to love in this movie the inspirational story is a great backbone to the character development as well as providing a very personal account of Zuckerberg s rise to fame The humorous references to situations that most of the sites user s will have found themselves in are very effective and provide a perfect balance to the tension in some of the more dramatic scenes as well as enabling the audience to connect with the film on a more personal level The Social Network is an engaging and provocative drama that may just make you think twice before you update your Facebook status in the future I would recommend it to anyone who uses Facebook on a regular basis you are guaranteed to give it the thumbs up,8
8 January 2011,Fantastic Fincher Filck,No words for this great movie from David Fincher Amazing treatment of character and simply awesome direction Direction 10 10 What else we can expect from director of this class the movie grows on you and you can actually connect with the characters of movie and even after the movie is over you left with the appetite of movie Screenplay 10 10 Beautiful handling of hearing scene and past life of main character It actually feels you are taking the hearing Cinematography 10 10 Decent work had nothing great to do for cinematographer Modestly done work Acting 9 10 Awesome Jesse was brilliant portraying Mark you can actually hate and love him during the movie Timberlake can also act Story 9 10 Story was not that great but its treatment was simply amazing Out and out must watch and highly recommended for computer enthusiast it can be very motivating for them,10
27 April 2019,Excellent,Is it an accurate portrayal of historical events Absolutley not Is it an excellently crafted drama about friendship and ambition Hell yes,10
20 March 2022,One of my favs,Jesse Eisenberg did such and amazing job portraying Mark Zuckerberg I also have to applaud Andrew Garfield for his performance in this movie as well This was so engaging to watch and really opened my eyes to the story of facebook,9
13 November 2010,The Social Network... a must for everyone who's on Facebook!,Genius And not just Mark Zuckerberg David Fincher take a bow The hardest part about real life storytelling is that most people already know what the story is so how do you get them interested and hooked on to the movie adaptation Fincher handles that expertly with an all new fresh cast Jesse Eisenberg is brilliant as the eccentric whimsical Mark Zuckerberg while Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake chip in with brilliant supporting roles With the way he handled Zodiac and now this Fincher has shown that he is one of Hollywood s most underrated directors Kudos to the cast to the direction and most importantly the script If you re on Facebook you better watch The Social Network,9
23 February 2021,Maybe it would be a higher rating if...,Mark Zuckerberg wasn t a total loser But he is and that s just how it goes so I m going to stand by it He stole the idea for Facebook and now his liberal agenda is literally ruining America s,3
16 June 2014,An ostensibly perfect but unaffecting biopic that is both timely and possibly immoral.,David Fincher s completely 21st century biopic turned investigation into society turned crime thriller Everything about The Social Network is seemingly or at least ostensibly perfect Jesse Eisenberg is an astounding piece of casting the acting is consistently believable the direction and editing is solid bordering on great the cinematography is grungy and dynamic the score is tense racing and sombre the sound is precise and the writing is witty rapid and dense Yet even with all this it is not enjoyable or even impactful All the characters are frustrating Mark Zuckerberg is self entitled and pretentious the Winklevoss twins are elitist and enviable all women are played to be less capable than the men and completely objectified and Sean Parker is opportunistic and manipulative Even Eduardo Saverin the only character the audience is capable of rooting for is incapable of seeing the forthcoming chaos David Fincher possibly did this on purpose but that makes The Social Network successful rather than enjoyable or wondrous resulting in a film that is little more than a particularly well constructed drama The overriding feeling when watching The Social Network is not wonderment inspiration or awe but instead resentment anger and even jealousy The society presented in The Social Network goes from an elitist and torturous fraternity full of sexism and hierarchy to a big business talk filled silicon valley to a cringe worthy British rowing society to a back stabbing hoody wearing too cool for school pretentious world playing international corporation all of which perfectly eloquate an America that stands for everything I find deplorable Overall if you are a member of the young hip society portrayed or at least don t find it immoral then you should find that The Social Network is a near perfectly constructed astute drama But for me I find the film merely respectable in craft even if I physically hate watching it few to no films have ever gotten under my skin and angered me so much It s social pertinence and timely delivery has lead some to compare it wrongly to Citizen Kane when truly the only similarity is in premise As with Martin Scorsese I find David Fincher to be more of a film maker than an artist and The Social Network is no greater example of that perfect in craft unaffecting in execution,8
9 March 2014,"Amazing film, great performances, script and of course directing",So The Social Network This movie is incredible it is awesome and after you ve seen it it makes you wonder how this story worked so well as a drama and not as a documentary or something It has a very interesting story if you haven t seen this go watch it really after I saw it I looked up the writers directors and I m looking forward to seeing more from Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher The acting in The Social Network is absolutely first rate Jesse Eisenberg is incredible in this movie it s like he was born to play this role he talks fast he s kind of geeky looking he was perfect as Mark Zuckerberg he really deserved an Oscar for it I gotta say after this he s an actor to watch out for Although Eisenberg was incredible the person who literally stunned me with his acting was Andrew Garfield this is the second film I ve seen that stars him I saw The Amazing Spider Man he was decent in that movie but here he is outstanding in this movie as Zuckerberg s friend Eduardo Saverin Vai Brasil I was on his side the entire movie partially because Zuckerberg s a dick but also because of Garfield s acting really something I can t believe he didn t get at least an Oscar nomination he was robbed right there The weakest actor in the movie was Justin Timberlake but he wasn t bad either The writing in this film is also outstanding every single line of dialogue is so interesting the story is really incredible Aaron Sorkin this guy is incredible he really made this movie fantastic with the screenplay And wow the soundtrack another incredible aspect of the movie every scene went along perfectly with the music I loved the slow pace of the soundtrack it really suited the film impeccably it is very memorable one of the best scores I ve heard The directing is also amazing David Fincher made a masterpiece He made even the scenes that were supposed to be super boring like the rowing scenes and made them awesome I can t really describe it but he showed a style of shooting that s really different from other directors I can tell this guy is great because he made a movie about Facebook and it s not boring it s great you get so invested in the story and the way it s told with scenes about the lawsuits in between the actual story and as time passes it explains everything why those guys were suing Zuckerberg and it worked incredibly well for the movie I look forward to seeing more from him The Social Network is a fantastic movie really all aspects are amazing everything goes together so well and it doesn t make much sense that it s so good it s a movie that could have been a documentary but the people in charge of this made a true masterpiece I strongly recommend this movie really go watch it I give it a well deserved 10 10,10
20 March 2023,"Bravado Fincher, Sorkin.",After the 5 min convo intro and the piano score starts the credits you know your in the hands of greatness Soon after there is a scene in which Eisenberg is narrating his thoughts whilst simultaneously demonstrating his coding ability and also showing the party life all at once This is film making at its highest calibre The screenwriting Sorkin throughout is scathing funny and informative However the single most genius part of this film is how Fincher creates a biopic at the same time delivering an almost semi thriller To my knowledge this has never been done before and would be impossible if not in The hands of a master director Another slice of brilliance is the casting of at the time almost nobodies in Garfield and Hammer Every actor delivers in spades One of the best dramas ever made,9
27 June 2011,Very Interesting.,I don t think i have ever had this much fun watching a Bio movie it usually annoying and slow you really cant believe how much you can learn from this film before i watched it and i know i m bit late i always thought well how good can it be its about the guy who invented Facebook so what But when i was forced by my girlfriend to watch this i realized that how much i didn t know and not just about Facebook but also about how hackers work or how companies and investors are only trying to rob you off By the time you get to the middle of the film and that s when Justin Timberlake shows up you get the real question what is the right thing and who do you trust these questions might seem easy to answer at first but don t be so sure think again The lines and the script in the movie is flawless and perfect Aaron Sorkin did a amazing job and the Oscar is the least that he can get This was David Fincher s best film since fight club i can even say better then that the way that the camera moves the attention to detail and pretty much every thing is perfect Now we come to my favorite part the acting I have to be honest i m not a huge fan of Jesse Eisenberg i never was but i really really have to give him a huge credit for this film he was fantastic truly pretty much all of the cast did a great job Justin Timberlake did a great job playing a jerk One thing that really did it for me was the Score and music great choice of music mixed with the talent of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is one of the strong points of the film which really brings out the story so good job to them So to my personal believe a near perfect film If you are a Facebook fan there is no doubt that you are gonna love it and if your not well you can learn a few things about how the world works Over all 9 10,8
30 January 2011,Review: The Social Network,The Pitch A Few Good Rasho men The Review Every generation has one or more events that shape and define it transforming the lives of those living through it and allowing those who look back on it in later years to understand it better In the twentieth century we had two world wars jazz and rock and roll transformed music television and the cinema transformed the visual arts and in the twenty first century We have a thing on your computer or your phone which allows you to play farm or jewel games to stalk people you used to go to school with and to tell all your friends when you ve had a bowel movement It s easy to be sniffy about Facebook really it is I just did it try it if you don t believe me but social media of which Facebook is the pre eminent form have transformed the way that we interact with each other My online friends range from their early teens to their late eighties and every demographic in between but how do you capture such an abstract concept on screen First you hire Aaron Sorkin responsible for one of the foremost small screen achievements The West Wing of the last ten years Sorkin also scripted A Few Good Men famous for its Cruise Nicholson courtroom confrontations which is handy as this is where The Social Network spends most of its running time for of course the more interesting story is not about Facebook itself but about the men or should that be boys who created it Sorkin is a past master at getting the most out of static situations because he knows how to write cracking dialogue but he also knows how to structure a story and so when the prospect of sitting through a succession of depositions where the finer details of the story of Facebook s creation gradually unfold feel too dry Sorkin s solution is to interleave the court actions with the rest of the narrative admitting a Rashomon influence in terms of the use of differing viewpoints and we are actually left to work out for ourselves initially what s happening and when as the time line skips back and forth from past to present Then you hire David Fincher When he realises that Sorkin s script is fantastic but is coming in at over two and a half hours his simple solution is to crank up the pace of the dialogue Relentless straight from the off we re thrust into a scene with Mark Zuckerberg and his girlfriend Erica who isn t real but just a construct of Sorkin s to engage us in the narrative but she and Mark rattle through their conversation and in eight minutes they flirt with each other s attention and they talk and they fight and they grandstand and Erica tells Mark what she really thinks of him and she walks out and Mark s off and he s inspired and he makes Facemash and his friends get involved and his ideas get bigger and he s growing out and outgrowing them and we see where he was and where he is and how it comes together and how it moves so fast and never stops and you have to keep up but soon you adjust to the pace and the speeches burst out like a Marx brother on speed but it s exhilarating and it whips by so quick that by the time you realise Mark s out of his depth The Social Network has you in its grip None of this would be possible without the quality of the cast that Fincher s then assembled Jesse Eisenberg falls into that genre of young actors that causes regular comparisons to Michael Cera but like the curly haired Scott Pilgrim star Eisenberg brings great subtlety and variety to the roles he plays and his Mark Zuckerberg is multi faceted at once compelling but dislikeable pathetic but powerful driven by his ego and a walking contradiction in terms Andrew Garfield has the less showy role as his closest possibly only friend Eduardo Saverin who mirrors Mark in key ways and then proves the diametric opposite in others Rounding out the headlining trio is the character of Sean Parker who is probably the closest to a rock star that the internet generation s had so who better to play him than Justin Timberlake in a sort of life imitates art kind of way Well that would be fine if Timberlake could act of course but instead it s remarkable Timberlake is a revelation and serves to add further momentum when he s introduced just when you thought that wasn t possible Everyone else is fantastic including Arnie Hammer as the Winkevoss twins which also serves to underline the depth of technical flair going on that you may not even notice But crucially the movie manages to stay impartial using the varied viewpoints to explain actions without at any point sitting in judgment although there are various inferences to Mark s similarity to a certain bolidy orifice but the overall attitude is more of pity than disdain towards him Somehow the talent assembled have taken what could have been a simple story of a trivial software development and made very much an epoch defining movie which effectively explains Facebook s relevance to the social strata of today at the same time that it spins its classic tale of men seeking power and clashing egos Fincher is now developing a long list of masterpieces and remains one of the most remarkable directing talents of the last twenty years The Social Network sits very well in that company Why see it at the cinema Because Fincher and Sorkin are masters of the art form and this really does justify the praise and awards talk being heaped on it The Score 10 10,10
1 October 2013,speedy and humorous movie,The mark Jasey Eisenberg of the 19 year old student who goes to Harvard University begins to make the site for increasing a friend in a university together with best friend Eduard Andrew Garfield A site spreads among college students in an instant By encounter with Sean Justin Timberlake the Napster founder it grows up to be a global huge site finally This movie is very speedy and a humorous conversation is incorporated Background from the launch of Facebook to have drawn to this In addition risk enthusiasm and readiness of his on making Facebook is depicted interesting Mark is a geek and gloomy He is not good at getting along with people but I am favor him for some reason I think I often use the net every day but people who really ignorant PC cannot understand this movie I thought it was like a Hollywood movie to realize the American Dream,8
11 September 2013,"He succeed, but...",This is a story that a boy who is a student of Harvard He makes the famous SNS Facebook in spite of his age He clashes with his company however he continues to create His awesomeness starts from the incident that he is dumped by his girlfriend I think it is certainly not good to rank girls however I was surprised that he hack the date easily He is so smart I wonder that why he hits on a lot of ideas and system I think producing something new is wonderful He is strong because he doesn t flinch and resists to adults The adults don t like him however they accept his ability He is too greedy Therefore he comes to be lonely I felt sad But I like the end and I could seem that he is a young student then I am lucky that I watched this film now He is a same student of college as me He does not only study but also he challenges to do something new I think that my school life is not active He looked like happy I try to do my best for realization of my goal too,
1 October 2013,Great thing,This film is about how facebook is created A main person is Mark Zuckerberg and he goes to Harvard University The start of making facebook is a small thing However the story is based on the real story so I thought it is worth watching it So many people in the world have their own facebook now and so do I so after I watched this film I was glad to know the progress of it Also I understood that Mark is such a great person to make facebook because it spread all over the world like I said It is about the man going to university so there are of course Mark s friends appeared The cooperate to create it It s very unbelievable that they make them and earn so much money Actually now I am an university student and almost same age as them However I don t have any confidence to do After I watched it I thought I have to be thankful to them for making these kind of very interesting Social Network,
12 October 2011,MARK ZUCKERBERG would HANG himself watching this crap!!!,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,1
20 May 2018,The Social Nightmare,One of the best films ever made and still relevant even today I give it a straight 10 The cast is brilliant the writing is precise like a scalpel the social critique and analysis is spot on It doesn t even matter if most of the stories being told are true or false or highly exaggerated the important part is that it captures the mood of Silicon Valley it s treatment of people its ruthless agenda Fincher and Sorkin let you feel an aching sadness as they define the dark irony of the past decade Applause,10
23 July 2016,The Social Network,The story is about a man start up the Facebook that many people uses in the world He is a university student and a skilled programmer but he is hard to deal with people By a chance that he breaks up his girlfriend he tried to create the cite of internet that ranking women student The site records enormous accesses and his name becomes widely known around his university The event is an origin of Facebook However it has also a lot of troubles He faces hardship to protect the site The film has dialogue and colors The genre of this movie is biography and drama It has sound effect and it is useful to enter the world of drama I think that it is easy to understand because I am familiar with social network system and I make use of Facebook In addition it is good that a pace of the story goes smoothly,
25 January 2020,Incredible,The Social Network is one of the best Dramatic movie Great Direction Strong Performance strong screenplay Films said to us loyalty to your friends,8
1 September 2021,It gets better,I don t like this film The concept and acting is truly incredible however the editing makes it unbearable the whole first half of the film is impossible to understand without subtitles It gets better though moving into the second half of the film it begins to get more enjoyable Although this film is considered a masterpiece I can t claim to see it I would say this is my least favourite David Fincher film Each character lacks depth the script paints them all as two dimensional and I found there was only one moment throughout the film where I felt sympathy for anyone Overall it s an interesting insight into Mark Zuckerberg and the becomings of Facebook and had the potential to be great but the script and editing really let it down,6
20 March 2021,Best movie ever made,Within two days of watching this movie The Social network is my favorite movie ever made I don t care what anybody says The way they do the line delivery the music and tons of other things I mean before this movie Mark Zuckerberg I thought was a good guy and after watching i think he s a huge jerk off The social network is easily the best movie ever made for me and I ve watched tons of amazing movies you need to watch this movie it s amazing,10
1 October 2013,The Social Network,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,7
1 October 2013,I learned many things from this film.,This film is about Mark Zuckerberg creates Facebook and how to make Facebook Before watching this film I ve never known about him After watching this film I m not impressed by him However I really respect him because he made the most wonderful website in the world I think everyone watches this movie won t have good impression of him because this film makes him bad man I don t know what is fact and what is a fiction in this film However from the directorial technique of this film everything looks like fact I think actors in this film are very nice I really think Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg and I dislike him from bottom of my heart in the scene he gets on girl s bad side From this film I learned that importance of decision and awfulness of desire I think Mark mistook what he chooses because he wants to make Facebook cool more and more This film makes us think importance of decision and awfulness of desire,
1 October 2013,difficulties,I wanted to know how Facebook was made Today many people use Facebook It s very useful and fun to have an account When I heard this was made by a young man I couldn t believe it I was expecting there were problems making face book before watching this but it was much more than my expecting A young man Mark is a student of Harvard university and he is an expert of computer One day he makes a homepage and this is the start His excellence at computer becomes business and causes lots of problems especially in relationship with people around him This movie goes on very fast so it was hard to catch every single thing However it was good to know the journey of Facebook,7
2 October 2013,I will make the account of Face Book.,A student of Harvard University has a good talent of network One day he was dumped by his girlfriend because he is rude and selfish He made a belly it and he spoke ill of her on his blog and made the Internet site what compare to girls who are in university because he got drunk Surprisingly the website gets 20 000 accesses but he gotten angry by teachers and all girls So he tried to make a new social network service at all He managed make some cool system so he fight a various problem He is actually selfish a bit but his attitude to stick to cool was so cool I have never thought this big and wonderful system made by students so I was surprised more I poor at network so I can t mention how his made this but I can tell you about his talent is excellent Now that Face Book is the most famous SNS I thought want to make the account of Face Book after watching this movie,7
6 October 2018,the untold story that deserves to be heard,Some dreams are meant to become a reality and this story shows it Not knowing much about how Facebook began in the first place this movie told me so many things about how Facebook was founded and explored routes of co founders and the broken barriers of certain relationships between partners The main score is simple yet so justifying and even though there are certain scenes shown that often feel out of place it all wraps up with an intense and jaw dropping ending with incredible performances While there have reportedly been some historical inaccuracies that were changed in the film the story makes you question what you thought you knew about the founding of Facebook,8
3 October 2010,A definition of our generation.,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,10
16 January 2022,for pretencious douchebags,I m sorry No my pradas are not at the cleaners but the movie is not it I think i would like it when i was 13 in my hipster era but now it just feels like adhd in the first part and like i didnt like it in the second In my observation the main audience of this movie can be divided in two groups finance bros similar to the wolf from wall street ones but get even less girls and andrew garfield stans And i too watched it because of andrew garfield and he was not disappointing The whole cast was great honestly Kinda iconic even Overall there was nothing technically bad about this movie but nothing awesome either except for the acting maybe It s just not the vibe,5
28 November 2010,An Exorcise in Filmmaking,Let me begin this review by saying this film is NOT about Facebook No this film is about one Mark Zuckerberg and his tumultuous journey to success in becoming the youngest billionaire in the world Firstly the performances The entire cast was phenomenal Each and every actor gave it their all and not one of them came up short Even Justin Timberlake gave a very strong performance Brenda Song though she didn t have a large role was surprisingly solid as well There is a lot of Oscar Buzz surrounding these young actors and I truly hope both Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield receive nominations Next the writing Aaron Sorkin s screenplay is nothing short of ingenious He should win an Oscar for conceiving the words Seanathon and Winklevai alone Let s not forget the score Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross composed a score that is beyond words These two gentlement deserve nothing less than an Oscar A cinematic masterpiece The Social Network defines our generation and deserves every award it can get,10
8 July 2012,Maybe the greatest written film ever,First of all you need to take away the true events of the invention and subsequent legal action as a result of Facebook The Social Network is its own story with its own characters and issues I realized that a lot of people disliked the film because it did not fully ring true to the real life events however people who feel this way are missing the point While the people depicted are real people and the main events are routed in truth TSN is its own film and therefore should be treated independent of the real story This is easily whether you hated the movie more than death or whether you loved it more than your own mother among the top 10 greatest written films in the history of cinema Every line of dialogue cracks and sizzles with a creative and brilliant fervor It is smart quick witty and more importantly it moves the story along through all of its brilliance Some people thought that the dialogue was convoluted and more pulp than anything but I am of the conviction that anyone who criticizes the writing lacks the intelligence to see its merit This review is only on the writing because if I was to cover every great thing about this film I would never stop writing,10
17 December 2010,"Good movie, but too overrated in my opinion",I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,7
9 October 2010,"A fascinating study of America's cultural fabrics of individualism, capitalism, and competition",The Internet isn t written in pencil Mark It s written in ink warns Erica Mark Zuckerberg s ex girlfriend after he tries to apologize to her for posting photos of her online without her consent in one of the film s early scenes This clearly is one of the facts of our life and our future whether we like it or not The Internet and more specifically social networking sites with all their benefits to society along with all of their pitfalls aren t going anywhere Mark Zuckerberg is of course well known for being one of the co creators of Facebook and currently holds the title of the world s youngest billionaire at a mere 26 years old In David Fincher s masterful The Social Network we follow the story of the juggernaut website s creation through the eyes of Zuckerberg his friend Eduardo Saverin two of their fellow classmates at Harvard the founder of Napster Sean Parker played brilliantly by Justin Timberlake in a performance worthy of a Best Supporting Actor nomination and a whole lot of lawyers sitting between all of them On the surface this topic would seem to make for a fairly boring film as movies about lawyers and their clients arguing about settlements and copyright issues rarely would be considered intriguing or exciting to watch However in the hands of Aaron Sorkin s fast paced script and David Fincher s crisp and well edited direction the movie is so enticing and fast paced that it feels almost like an action movie even though the movie is 2 hours of dialogue without any action whatsoever Scenes of dialogue between characters often only last 20 or 30 seconds before quickly moving onto another scene I am not sure if I have ever seen a movie with as much dialogue and exposition as this move at such an exciting pace Without going into too many details about the plot much of the story is focused on the large egos of each of the creators and how they each crave individual recognition power and prestige for the site s sudden growth and success After the website begins to show promise and becomes highly profitable the creators then file lawsuits against each other and each claim ownership of the idea The first 2 3 of the film are set on Harvard s campus where the characters give us a wealth of insight no pun intended into America s cultural definition of success as measured by wealth and individual success even at the expense of others I found the topic to be a fascinating look into the ongoing struggle societies and cultures have between trying to balance individualism and pluralism Cultures in the West most specifically America are of course mostly individual based focused mostly on capitalism and economic power even at the expense of others including family and community relationships whereas more cultures in the East are focused primarily on families communities and pluralism and those people care less about wealth prestige and individualism One feels that the characters in this movie are all good well meaning people but they feel an uncontrollable urge an almost addiction to look out for themselves and their own prestige first to create a zero sum game of success even though one can sense of level of loneliness some of them feel most specifically Zuckenberg s lack of friends or a social life The Social Network explores the complex relationship between these values and does so in an intelligent way that never preaches or talks down to its audience The film simply tells the story of these characters in a very restrained and straightforward manner and allows the audience to form its own opinions of the story on the screen Capitalism and competition in America are never directly criticized nor should they be as without them we wouldn t be the economic or military superpower that we are today However even with our financial and individual successes one can t overlook the downsides that also come from living in a culture that values those over pluralist and community based ideals Given the fact that Facebook and other social networking sites will certainly be around to stay what does this mean for America s future Will America always continue to be a me society where individualism and competition are valued over pluralism And will social networking sites just promote those values only more so in the future Is it possible for technology to change our values or does technology only serve to reinforce our values Now those are the 6 9 billion dollar questions,9
18 January 2011,"In the end, it's all about connection and sharing",I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,8
23 June 2011,was i watching the same movie,I laughed when i first heard about a Facebook movie and could not bring myself to see it That s when the reviews started coming in claiming this was Oscar potential and i reconsidered Now clearly i was watching something else because this was the definition of the word average How this film is in the top 250 and films like E T aren t is a disgrace Yes there is some good acting especially from Jesse Eisenberg who proved he can act like someone who isn t a complete social reject and certain scenes do grip you but overall this movie just kept me wondering if the only reason people enjoyed it is because its about Facebook and it is important for the world we live in To sum it up average movie that takes advantage of the modern generation,5
2 October 2013,what he lost?,I am very interested in and excited when I watch this movie about the creation of Facebook Now a lot of people use SNS like Facebook is very famous around the world So many people s attention are engaged by knowing how did create Facebook I did not know that Mark Zuckerberg s broken heart trigger making great programming by his ability I learn from this movie is that there are a variety of the way to make own skill and ability to good account And a prompt to success a big thing is not always respectable thing Mark Zuckerberg is the Facebook s programmer and progenitor He is spring into fame now along with Facebook doing good business He is just a university student but he can gain himself a reputation and wealth There are something a lot to be gained for him but also he loses a lot For example he loses his important friends and then he is taken legal action by his friends He dose legal procedure many days and he is under a lot of stress from the lawsuit and the business When I compare his prosperity and his friend s relationship I do not think his life is totally success story Everyone wants to success in their life However we must understand that more and more we get rights we have to pay great expenses Usually it is described by the contrast friends and love with business and money This story is the typical of it This movie makes me think the importance of it s balance,9
5 August 2017,Relationship or Money?,Mark Zuckerburg a student of Harvard University who becomes famous for an opener of Facebook later on is claimed by affluent two brothers that Mark steals their ideas and co founder and Mark s best friend Eduardo sues Mark Before watching the film I expect that the story will be successful how he has achieved the remarkable feat However in the film his struggling points such as relationship with people and money are described For instance he is dumped by his girlfriend Erica in order to retaliate against her he opens a bad site for the use of advantage of his programming ability One interesting point is that the universally prestigious social network service Facebook which is to communicate with others all over the world is created by a man who is not good at making a good relationship Even if Mark Zuckerburg is one of the youngest millionaires in the world he holds no true happiness This shows that family bond and friendship are crucially significant rather than money Yet according to my search not everything in the story is based on the true story Seemingly before producing the film though the director asks him to have an interview the director is turned down Actually the story is unreliable to seize as Mark Zuckerburg s autobiography but I believe that the film wants to convey a message to us that relationship makes our life,5
25 January 2022,"Perfect Drama, Great acting",Before we get into the movie itself let s take a moment to appreciate the incredible performances of Jesse Eisenberg Justin Timberlake and Andrew Garfield The laptop smash scene will go down as one of the best actings of all time Now about the movie The Social Network is a drama based on a true story creation of Facebook and they blended it together so well The cuts between the present and the past are perfectly balanced because they make the audience wonder when the braking point will be The character development is great as we get attached for some characters especially Eduardo Saverin Some historical changes were made to make the film more focused on the essential and also to be more interesting and captivating which I think was done smartly Therefore I would suggest the film to everyone as it portrays the consequences of success and also of our actions,9
20 May 2018,This film made me thing how internet can change our life,I really really love this film This film is very special to me This made me think how a software can change the world and how about social network how about friendship and everything So it help me think about idea to create software and build one for me a product called TheDevBand,9
16 May 2011,A Brilliant Era-Defining Film,As I m sure many of you know David Fincher s The Social Network 2010 is a riveting story about the creation of the social networking site FACEBOOK and the whole mess in between I must say I was not exactly sure what to expect going into this movie I remember seeing the trailer for the first time and thinking What the crap FACEBOOK movie already It s just too soon To my great surprise The Social Network ended up being quite a treat It s the perfect film for this era where anyone between the ages of 15 and 30 dive into social media as a means of communication First off the performances are absolutely phenomenal Jesse Eisenberg who plays Mark Zuckerberg the creator of facebook plays this role in a way I could not have possibly imagined Normally I would refer to him as poor man s Michael Cera However I ve gained an incredible amount of respect for the actor after catching this flick Let s just say he was made for this role The script is so quick and witty and he delivers his lines so freely as to create one of the most accurate youth pics I ve seen in terms of dialogue since Greg Mottola s Superbad 2007 I was even proud of Mr JT in his role as Sean Parker He s the perfect parasite I haven t disliked a character so much since Mo Nique as Mary in Lee Daniels Precious 2009 This film grips you and drags you into a world where you can t identify with anyone Everyone is flawed but this works That s what makes it so real The Social Network is not just about FACEBOOK It s about friendship greed and betrayal It illustrates how far one is willing to go even if it means risking everything even if it means throwing it all away even if it means sacrificing all of your real friends for 500 million facebook friends This film is not simply for entertainment It s art for art s sake A true masterpiece of our time,9
6 February 2011,Fincher does it again,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,9
8 December 2010,"In a Nutshell: ""The Social Network"" (8/10)",The Social Network A million dollars isn t cool You know what s cool A billion dollars Alright put it this way you wake up on a good morning and you say I m gonna make a movie about something 500 million people use like and spend time on every day How do you think this movie is going to do The answer is really one of three options one it earns loads of money and tops everyone s expectations Two it becomes as horrible as any twilight movie and just makes the money based on anticipation Or three it sinks in so bad you regret waking up that morning My fellow movie goers build your hopes up it is option one As you may have seen read or heard this is the story behind the creation of one of our current time s most prominent inventions Facebook But as interesting as it may sound I thought it s quite scary because such an idea is not one that gets a second a chance If a movie is made about it there isn t a big chance another one will be The good news is the minds behind making such a picture aren t of some average movie makers This is a tale of success and a parody of emotions a blend of sophisticated intellect and willful deceit The story goes around college life of Facebook co founder Mark Zuckerberg a man who as depicted on the poster is a punk a genius a traitor and a billionaire From a college nerd hacking into Harvard s network to the world s youngest billionaire the road isn t as bumpy as you may think but as Mark manages to make 500 million friends he gets himself some enemies On the movie making side the genius bunch behind the scenes lead this project to a quite impressive outcome Executive producer Kevin Spacy Hollywood s infamous screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and Academy Award nominated director David Fincher of Se7en and Fight Club all combine their efforts to take a few uprising acting talents and one of the coolest ideas for a movie this year and make a blockbuster From the opening dialogue of the film you know you re in for a screen writing treat But as it moves forward chemistry arises between all sides from acting to editing to screenplay and ultimately to directing I recall 20 minutes into watching this all I wanted to do is find out who s editing the answer is Kirk Baxtor and Angus Wall editors whose last project had been Fincher s The curious case of Benjamin Button The artistic mix and mash of scenes from the past and the present and the clash of flashbacks and flash forwards in The Social Network depict the exceptional talent of the editing team and off course David Fincher himself In this film upcoming youngster Jesse Eisenberg plays the lead role of the man behind Facebook Mark Zukerberg I remember a few weeks before the movie release I saw a picture of Eisenberg online captioned The next Michael Cera I guess an opposite scenario would be Cera s best fit now because Jesse Eisenberg has just stepped his game up quite a few notches We ve seen Eisenberg before the clumsily funny side of him in Zombieland side by side with mighty Woody Harelson and the awkwardly confused teenager in Adventureland against the world champion of the awkwardly confused Kristen Stewart This time however Eisenberg takes it deeper into serious drama accepting the challenge of portraying a real life significant character that everyone can relate to The way he did it makes me think he d probably watched every video and heard every speech of Zuckerberg since he s made it to fortune and fame A little award shower on Eissenberg s head wouldn t be much of a surprise in the next few months And how can I forget our beloved Justin Timberlake who s probably finally found his perfect acting fit in the role of Sean Parker creator of Napster the other punk that inspired Zuckerberg s success Eissenberg Timberlake together with Andrew Garfield who plays Zuckerberg s best friend Eduardo Saverin are about the 3 faces you ll be looking at all movie long They ll do anything but bore you In a nutshell even if The Social Network doesn t strike the liking of Mr 26 year old 6 9 billion dollar Mark Zuckerberg it will serve the opposite to its viewers Set your expectations on watching a realistic drama about the life of the planet s youngest self made billionaire and his most controversial story in the business world today and you won t be disappointed,8
2 November 2010,interesting movie,If you think this is about lines of programming codes or boring scenes of a nerd designing a website the whole movie then you are wrong This movie is about a dramatic funny interesting story of success It is not mainly about Facebook as many would think it is about the genius guy who invented it to attract this much people all around the world with a simple idea It shows us the story of being hated alone with no social life at all nor girl friends and how a very simple idea which started with hacking and stealing pictures of girls from his university and publishing them online gained all the attraction from all students at the university and then taking the secret that attracted all these people and developing a new idea that can have the same impact on them and brings the whole college social experience online It shows you how he started how this website spread like this what did he do after that to actually make money of it and how it ends up with a huge company with the youngest billionaire in the world a success like that never comes without hatred without people trying to shut the whole thing down and without friends betrayal you will see a lot of lawyers talking scenes trying to sew him for what he did to his friend and to the people he was supposed to work with regarding a similar idea it s full of funny comments and rude behavior nothing more can be said except this movie is a big deal perfect actors perfect scenario perfect music,9
13 January 2011,A Prolific Review: The Social Network,Imagine a 500 million users active in a social networking site that beats the competition Isn t that a perception that we are willing to receive Or we need to take the risk to do a lot of bad habits just to improve the creation that a person is really passionate about Mark Zuckerberg the real one falls into this category but he made his creation millions of milestones worldwide But before he made his dorm room project called Facebook the law was definitely against him The Social Network is based on a biographical book The Accidental Billionaires written by non fiction author Ben Mezrich who also wrote Bringing Down The House and also titled differently as 21 The film plots about Mark Zuckerberg s Jesse Eisenberg revenge on his girlfriend by getting wasted on his college dorm room and starting to hack his way on a website called FaceMash that is similar to HotorNot and comparing her to farm animals by hacking through a bunch of photos on Face Books on Harvard He was aided by Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield As a hacking prodigy he was sued by the Harvard community for an intrusion from the university s computers Started only as an offensive idea but it occurred to Zuckerberg that the fact is that there is a fascinating idea behind FaceMash Afterwards Zuckerberg s programming skills were recognized by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and Divya Nerendra whom are students in Harvard and asks for writing codes for a social networking site called HarvardConnection but will use the domain from Harvard s website But later on Zuckerberg tend to ignore Winklevoss idea and turn it into a social networking site that was only exclusive to Harvard students And he was aided by his dorm room friends particularly Chris Hughes and Dustin Moskovitz It turn s out that they failed to privately secure the site to Harvard studs and it was exclusive to all prestigious universities As the company grew it reveals that what they were aiming is all about the money and business It is completely based on the book which was quite a false biographical statement Zuckerberg never took revenge to his girlfriend His idea for FaceMash were only for fun according from an interview But it was completely offensive yes And Zuckerberg apologized publicly for that In amidst of accepting the help of the Winklevoss he was also accused of stealing an idea for a social network He was hacker but not a stealer He created a social networking site called thefacebook back in 2005 and ranked to be the most visited social network exclusively to college studs and later on to all of ages And the whole wide web is patronizing the only social network that beats Friendster and MySpace which were a former bright companies It is now called Facebook Furthermore this film gave a lot of impact to the real CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg never liked this film because they made it while he was still living And he didn t want his fidelity to be revealed Writer Aaron Sorkin also made the whole story to fictional and his naivete insulted Zuckerberg a little bit This was a good biographical film that David Fincher directed after all as in Fight Club and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button that garnered Oscar awards Facebook already won the heart of the world wide web The question is will it win the heart of the 2011 Golden Globes or the Oscars,9
29 October 2010,Engaging but not profound,The Social Network s promotional tag line reads You don t get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies As a matter of fact the narrative seems to suggest you don t get a site as global or profitable as Facebook without some serious big money investment Indeed without the flashy business bluffing of Sean Parker Justin Timberlake thefacebook com remains the popular but unendurable dream that never was of Havard friends and co founders Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield This point is significant the raison d tre for the film both in story and narrative terms has its very seeds in the gem of Facebook itself The very nature of this story is governed by its necessary pace it s arguable that Facebook could only become the site that it now is by expanding so rapidly that it could beat any other would be competitors and meeting the profit demands of short term capital This would preclude Saverin and Zuckerberg making it alone and thus in turn making it at all and so since their final decision to sue is because of Facebook s international success Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss both played by Armie Hammer would never have sought compensation from Zuckerberg for violations of their intellectual property This is the quiet tragedy at the heart of Fincher s film But if this is inherent in the material the director doesn t stress it From the outset there s that contradiction familiar to all of Fincher s films a certain level of interest in the material as it presents itself to him but a careful deliberate detachment from it on his own part This means that even if Fincher knows how to stage a scene and his directorial style is consistently immaculate his work as a whole is uneven when the script is formidable you get something like Zodiac 2007 when patchy something like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button 2008 Fincher s latest film presents its world in a matter of fact manner and in doing so creates an apparently authentic sense of life at one of the world s most elitist institutions In having events unfold mostly through Zuckerberg s viewpoint though Sorkin s script lacks the critical emphasis required of Fincher to make a genuinely provocative film that reaches beyond the betrayal of friendship between Zuckerberg and Saverin More at idfilm blogspot com,
10 October 2010,The Social Network is socially important,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,8

13 October 2010,"Not the best movie ever, but still highly entertaining",The Social Network is a 2010 drama film directed by David Fincher Se7en Zodiac It is essentially a story that tells the drama that ensued during and following the creation of Facebook Starring Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg Facebook s creator the story is told through flashbacks as Mark is being simultaneously sued by two separate parties The first party is Mark s former best friend and business associate Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield while the second is a pair of twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss both played by Armie Hammer What s really surprising about The Social Network is how engaging the entire production is Even when nothing all that important is going on it s set up in a way that makes you want to see more The vast majority of the film is just dialogue from really smart people but it is exciting to watch To me that s really impressive especially given the fact that the film doesn t move at a quick pace It s a slower paced film but that isn t necessarily a bad thing especially with the way the film plays out Despite being on the slow side it s very exciting and never gets boring This excitement may actually come from how well you get to know the characters I m not sure how accurate a job the film does at representing the characters within it but the film does do a good job at characterizing them all You actually end up feeling worse for the people suing Mark than for Mark himself Zuckerberg acts like a jerk for the majority of the film He s unlikable and ends up losing his girlfriend before the opening credits His former best friend Eduardo Saverin ends up not being in the film for a good portion of the final half but really is the character that ends up being empathized with the most He more or less gets cheated out of the company by Mark and is abandoned mid way for Napster founder Sean Parker played by Justin Timberlake Parker is far less serious a person than Saverin but promises Mark that Facebook will take off if he comes on board The other main characters the Winklevoss twins also get deceived by Mark They came up with an idea similar to what Facebook ended up being and they hired Mark to program for them He ended up turning around and creating a basic version of what is now known as Facebook By the end of the film you end up caring about all of the characters even if you don t want to Like mentioned above Mark Zuckerberg is a jerk and while you don t like him for that he s built up in such a way that you will end up caring for him Each of the other characters gets enough screen time to develop as well and this is brought out by the excellent acting done by each actor They really all do a great job bringing their characters to life and do it with consistency There are not really any times where a character acts unexpectedly or their emotional response doesn t relate to the current situation The subtleties of acting all appear to be there and for that I m quite grateful I am not however grateful for the way the story was told It s not so much the idea of flashbacks being the driving point of the story but it s the fact that this storytelling idea gets constantly pushed aside after the film takes off There are 30 minute sections at a time where this tactic is forgotten about Having flashback sequences that long is a maneuver that I didn t feel worked out all that well If given a couple intermissions where the present day interactions occurred even for a minute it would have been a great way to tell the story As it is it ends up being fairly meaningless The only other grip I really have with the film is the CGI used during one scene Mark and Eduardo go outside into the cold and their breath seems really fake By far one of the pettiest gripes I ve ever had but it did eliminate some of the immersion that the film tried so hard to have The Social Network is a film that works on almost every level It s engaging entertaining well made and well acted It s a solid package of everything required in a film coming together It has real tension the characters are well developed and while they aren t all likable you ll end up caring about them all While the flashback structure of the film doesn t always work the way it should it ultimately is a decent way to show the story instead of just jumping forward in time If nothing more it s the best film I ve seen so far from David Fincher and it s an impressive film to watch,8

10 December 2011,"Social Network, Best of it's Year",Eduardo Saverin Sorry My Prada s at the cleaners Along with my hoodie and my fuck you flip flops you pretentious douchebag The Social Network is definitely the best movie of the year about the substantial growth of the disreputable but well off website Facebook Everything was magnificent with the well written screenplay of Sorkin and great direction of Fincher its simply the best People did give second opinions about this movie being about facebook but the Social Network is the complete opposite of what they thought This film is set in 2003 about a Harvard sophomore named Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg that comes up with an idea while intoxicated And creates a website that allows you to rate the hotness of girl in Harvard dorms which reaches 200 000 views and brings it s attention to the Winklevoss twins They meet up with Mark and tell their idea of making a social network using Harvard edu Thinking that he can do better he meets up with his friend Edwardo Saverin and decides that they will make the website instead splitting the share 30 70 when Facebook gets around Sean Parker Justin Timberlake creator of Napster wants to get in with the project and gets a warm welcome from everyone except Saverin I don t want to tell you the whole movie even though you probably already know so I think I ll stop there The Social Network was directed by the one and only David Fincher Zodiac Fight Club Se7en and more and is his absolute best work The best acting would have to be tied with Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield showing their best support for a movie I wasn t surprised when I found out that Peter Travers Rolling Stone said that this was the best of the year and it should of won the Grammy instead of Kings Speech But it did win the Grammy for best soundtrack by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for film editing by Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter and for the adapted screenplay of course by Andy Sorkin In the two disc collectors edition it shows Fincher s distinctive technique in film making Shooting the first scene for ninety nine times David s patient directing tries to make this movie be perfect as possible and of course is successful Fincher and Cronenweth made a great choice using the best High Definition quality so far by RED Digital Cinema It interests me a lot that almost every known movie coming out recently is being filmed in RED I looked it up and most of the products they sell is well over 20 000 dollars must be really good They re using it again while they reunite to work with a new remake of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo which I have high hopes for Andy Sorkin s adapted screenplay is one of the most intelligent and skilled I have seen so far Nonetheless the screenplay being so complex it must have been complicated for the editors Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter But by cutting all the camera angles and showing everybody have their spotlight they succeed and win an Oscar for their tremendous support The costume design was nothing special but is will put into wearing the same clothing that they would wear in real life You can never get enough of The Social Network watching it the thousandth time still gives me the same satisfaction as the first time if not more You can t miss a second of this movie if you love this film as much as me buy the two disc collectors edition because who wouldn t love over two hours of special features Eduardo Saverin You better lawyer up asshole because I m not coming back for 30 I m coming back for EVERYTHING Well known scenes After Eduardo finds out that his facebook shares has been diluted he storms out the doors to confront Mark Zuckerberg Andrew Garfield s finest performance When Zuckerberg and Sean Parker are at a club Sean explains to Mark about Facebook s next step Even with the loud music almost covering their voices the amazing script compels us to pay complete attention to what they re saying Actors to watch out for Andrew Garfield Jesse Eisenberg Justin Timberlake Armie Hammer Max Minghella and of course Josh Pence,10

6 February 2011,Another misleading fabrication from Hollywood,Taken out of context this would prove an entertaining movie However the story is based on a character assassination As the real characters have said the movie focuses on being extremely accurate by portraying the wardrobe accurately and then blowing up minor truths which were not important in real life and distorting the facts to offer us a perverse version of the truth This smacks of mudslinging on the big screen and I don t like that though I did rather enjoy watching the movie it was for me more a commentary on the Hollywood licence to lie and cheat us out of the truth because it s too boring instead presenting us with a fake dramatisation and passing it off as a true story Truth has little to do with this story Hollywood is indeed the Lord of Lies not something to be proud of,6
4 October 2010,Fantastic!,One of the best movies I have ever seen Jessie Eisenberg is amazing as Mark Zuckerberg He was truly the scene stealer of this movie Hoping that an Oscar nomination is coming his way because it is highly deserved I loved the way that no one involved was made out to be the bad guy and even the twins didn t portray a good twin evil twin persona Heck even if Zuckerberg IS the bad guy you are able to forgive him for that My one and only regret that the music from the trailer was not played at the beginning or end of the movie That song Radiohead s Creep as sung by the Vega Choir is mesmerizing and haunting,10
3 February 2019,Great movie that shows Zuckerberg is an a-hole,Well done movie that shows the story how The Facebook came to be and how Zuckerberg scammed some others on the way This movie is from 2010 and since then Zuckerberg has confirmed by his actions that he indeed is just the a hole this movie depicts him to be Privacy and free speech have become concepts alien to FB Google s motto once said don t be evil before it was removed but once money seriously kicks in it only gets worse as lust for money is the root of all evil Looking out for the sequel,8
27 December 2010,The Curious Case of Mark Zuckerberg,Spellbindingly fast paced conversation between a college couple At the end of it I want you to know from the bottom of my heart that you re an asshole silenced by the Indian censors asserts the girlfriend Jessica Albright Rooney Mara and ditches the guy He s angry confused but doesn t know how to react Returns to his hostel room gets drunk bitches about her bra size family name in his blog and finally designs a site Facemash com to rate hotness of girls from different colleges The site gets around 22 000 clicks in around 2 hours which crashes his Harvard college network gets him a 6 months academic probation This hurt confused Computer nerd genius is Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg outstandingly self restrained the youngest billionaire founder of Facebook I d read that a film was being made based on a book on the Facebook founder but I knew about the director being David Fincher only after it released I was more than excited for a Fincher film and these initial 10 minutes proved my enthusiasm right Then on it kept me right on edge The story is effectively narrated through the progression of two simultaneous lawsuits First one by the Winklevoss twins both played cleverly by Armie Hammer thanks to digital trickery on Mark Eduardo Savarin Andrew Garfield the Second one by Eduardo on Mark Another highlight of this movie was Justin Timberlake playing celebrity Sean Parker who brought a great impact on the music industry by starting sites such as Napster Plaxo also seemingly inspired Mark to grow Facebook The characters have a definitive nature of their own the cast of actors comfortably fill their shoes Based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich the screenplay Aaron Sorkin is carefully filled witty humorous monologues twists turns as well as heavy handed fast paced dialogues which keep the viewer engaged throughout the 2 hour runtime and works on many different layers This being a movie about the designing of a website there was a great danger of it going bonkers Surprisingly it is filled with computer details which it carefully skims over just like Syriana A Beautiful Mind and saves the layman the trouble of grasping technical details As for the ending it left me satisfied in a way it winded it s way upto there Director Fincher of Fight Club fame has a unique kick ass style of his own like all great directors with respect to his narration and the way he brings about the end without compromising on the detailing and story line Collaborating with his regular Cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth Editors Baxter Wall seems to have been a good decision as the technical detailing of the film was brilliant The melodious soundtracks blended into the scenes and completed the feel of the movie I managed to catch up with an interview where Zuckerberg himself gave a nod to the casting costumes acting and other details although he didn t agree to certain cinematic liberties taken He said he didn t start Facebook due to a failed relationship but agreed that those were the exact same shirts he used to wear This movie could easily have been the run of the year at the Academy But against Inception this one should hopefully end up with more than a few nominations I hope it at least bags an Oscar for an adapted screenplay and squeeze in for Best Director too please 9 10 minus one because my 10 10 belongs to Fincher s Fight Club,9
2 August 2019,Pretty good but not perfect,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,6

3 October 2013,Life,I have been used FACEBOOK for 1 years so I wanted to see this movie FACEBOOK was founded by university student I also university student However I can not make social network such as this This movie show not only foundation but also a person s life to us The number of Users of FACEBOOK exceed one billion It is remarkable There is the SNS company where management does not go well University students can found companies in America We university students should follow it It is not severe in terms of age If there is even an idea we can build a company So I would like to see this movie for many of university students It may give a motivation and hint of management University students have a lot of time so we should use effectively it It is how effectively you use the available time that counts,7
13 July 2018,"This isn't a good movie about the come-up of Facebook, but rather a fantastic tale of friendship & betrayal due to wealth & popularity.",One of the greatest movies of all time Where people go wrong is in thinking this is an entirely accurate documentary about Facebook which it s not,10
3 March 2017,The Social Network has well-deserved buzz.,The Social Network is a rich modest and hard hitting character drama that explores the politics of one of the most beloved and most used social networking internet websites Facebook David Fincher director captures and explores the egos and personalities behind Facebook For me the acting the stole the show was Andrew Garfield who deserved an Oscar nomination for his performance here I enjoyed this film very much and I recommend it highly,8
22 June 2022,My favourite film of all time,Dark tragic emotionally raw a necessary story for our time and one of the best character studies ever told with the subtle yet perfectly suited cinematography and score making it a masterpiece of film A story if not completely factual feels at least emotionally and thematically truthful to a man who has impacted a generation or more The brilliance is that the character of Zuckerberg embodies Facebook They are inextricably linked The anxieties hopes dreams and false beliefs of happiness and connection the arrogance and image insecurities and prestige that are perpetuated by the Facebook we all know and are impacted by are fully embodied and personified through Zuckerberg in this film At its most basic is a man searching for acceptance and happiness relatable for all but particularly poignant for anyone who uses the app Its promise of a path to the fulfilment of connection acceptance and thus happiness is like a drug however offering addictive glimpses of happiness yet only works to plague on and deepen the insecurity inside us all,10
15 May 2018,A Gorgeous movie all of the time.,I watched this film before 2 years ago i guess but i was feeling that i forgot it and i need to watch it again and now i m really speechless and i wish that i watched this a masterpiece ever actully this film was pure and peerless and basically David Fincher are one of the best directors in like this films and specially when the film talking about some interesting subjects like this textually the screenplay was too perfect and excellent and i know it s Biography film but the drama was very breath taking and i ve ever seen this film so now i m really sure of my opinion it s underrated film and it s don t matter if he won in 2010 or not but the important thing is why people don t do justice to him i mean this film was completely perfect with all ways Ok i should to say that the film is a masterpiece and absolutely i ll re watch it again and again in some other time,10
1 June 2022,7 stars for Movie creation and for Mark Zuckerberg,I don t like Mark Zuckerberg for some reason but I realized not because of this movie though it impacted very little on my decision He s blessed and taken right action on right time so when god blesses him then I must think good about him and bless him even though I m younger than him So now I like you Mark Zuckerberg Thank you Mark Zuckerberg you reached your destiny I wish you all the best I also appreciate the creators of this movie and lead actor to do an uneasy task to make it happen Flick is very good one must watch if its area of their interest,7
19 November 2020,The social network review.,The acting is grea jessie eissenberg gives a grat peformance the story is interesting and i was never bored The ending felt unsatisfying and left me wanting more from the film,8
25 April 2012,A masterpiece that gets better every time I watch it.,When I first saw The Social Network in theaters I was excited to see a new film from my favorite director David Fincher I was stunned by the outcome of the film and was blown away at the talents displayed through the direction writing acting editing cinematography just about everything that makes a great film The Social Network is an example of why I love movies But the thing that really strikes me about the film is how it improves upon multiple viewings Every time I watch it I notice something new about the plot and it s structure that I missed before But more interestingly I see why people are calling it a generation defining film The movie never directly explore what our generation has shaped into But what this movie does is portray it in the most realistic fashion I could ever imagine a film doing It s almost as if I m right there experiencing 2003 all over again As I said earlier the writing is brilliant Not only in dialogue but in structure of the story and the study of its characters Aaron Sorkin deserved his Oscar for the screenplay and it was disappointing that Fincher didn t win for directing and handling this script with such grace and creativity I also was thoroughly impressed by its cast of Jesse Eisenberg Andrew Garfield and surprise surprise Justin Timberlake I look forward to seeing these three in future films working with other directors Ever since I saw Fight Club which is ranked highly among my all time favorites I became and huge admirer of Fincher and wanted to see his other works The Social Network like all of Fincher s film is very similar to Fight Club in terms of dark lighting and how the camera focuses on characters However it manages to be such a different film in terms of editing mood and themes it shows how Fincher can handle new ground and becoming another masterpiece among his films,10

29 October 2010,"A good look into the Facebook culture and its origins. This is more of a character study, so don't expect action or any special effects here. Definitely worth a watch!",Greetings from hicflicks wordpress com I have been eagerly awaiting the release of this film and it actually turned out to be quite a good and engaging watch First off this movie hardly has any action or special affects Its more of a deep character study So if you are more of the action loving or special affects seeking guy gal then this may not interest you as much Even without that the story kept me quite engaged throughout the length of the film The director of the film viz David Fincher is one of my fav directors and it looks like in this movie he chose to concentrate more on the story rather than showing off his cinematic and camera skills Anyways the story revolves around Facebook and its origins and focuses on its now billionaire founder Mark Zuckerberg who is also the youngest billionaire in the world As expected by me the origin of facebook and its concept was motivated by women Here is a guy the founder who found it difficult to get invited to cool parties in college and also found it hard to get girls and keep a relationship And he managed to create a portal and attract guys who could easily get girls otherwise to get to sign up on That in my mind is plain brilliant He first made facebook exclusive to only those students who had a harvard edu email id under the notion that girls think high of guys from Harvard Then he slowly made the service available in other prestigious colleges and finally to the world Also at the time facebook originated there were similar services already available like MySpace and Friendster Then why was it that Facebook did so ridiculously better I don t want to give away too much but after seeing the movie you will realize that they built the service by giving detailed thought to basic human behaviour and action And yeah a small thing like Relationship Status on facebook was one of those seemingly petty but at the same time crucial things Btw the ending of the film is a classic example of the power gritty addiction of facebook which most people will not admit,8
9 September 2013,Life of FB,David Fincher well known for his spectacular Direction Movie was all about the Story of a social networking website which is known by almost everyone in the world called facebook Life of nineteen years old guy who started Facebook and the way he became billionaire was explained Jesse Eisenberg a guy who has done his best in zuckerberg role Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake as well adopted to their respective roles Movie starts with a guy named zuckerberg who has been often violating university regulations and always under authority probation He had an idea of Facebook through his senior members who does not have a capability to implement the task asked him for help After commencement of Facebook Seniors had decided to confront him legally about stolen idea of Facebook Eventually Mark won the case after interminable negotiations Unfortunately Mark zuckerberg shown dissatisfaction about some scenes in the movie which are not actually happened in his life,8
9 May 2020,"Yes, I'm writing this in 2020",I was not very impressed when I first saw this in 2010 and gave it a 7 10 it s a very good movie not a perfect one But then I realized I keep coming back to this movie every now and then It s that kind cinema magic chemistry that pulls me back once a year or so I guess the fact that I m a computer engineer and entrepreneur myself contributes to this too but mainly it s the prefect blend of the pace the writing the dialogs the acting and Trent Reznor s soundtrack that make this all happen I give it 9 10 and not 10 10 because of the ending tho It comes unexpected even looks like something was cut out during the edit phase,9
4 October 2010,THE SOCIAL NETWORK: A Masterpiece?,We have essentially two female characters in the whole film Erica Rooney Mara and Christy Brenda Song The former s rejection of Zuckerberg is painted as the catalyst for his journey to the top The latter lady is a Facebook groupie who jumps Eduardo in a public restroom becomes his girlfriend glommer on and then in the film s most ridiculous scene goes ballistic because his relationship status on Facebook is still single Oy vey THE SOCIAL NETWORK s approach to the fairer sex is about as complex as those found in any of Fincher s films which is not complex at all No offense Ripley Perhaps this remove is meant to convey Zuckerberg s own mystification with women But considering the director s track record Hey the guy s not Almod var Read my full review and more at WWW STEVENSPIELBLOG COM,8
21 January 2016,"Betrayal, Revenge, Ambition, Greed and the Internet.",The Social Network 2010 Reviewed by Martin Davis Retrospect Film on Facebook Emerging in the 90 s as one of Hollywood s most exciting talents David Finchers decision to direct The Social Network seemed an unusual one to many at the time The man who had brought us Se7en and Fight Club was now going to take on what some were dismissively calling The Facebook movie The Social Network is in reality much less a film about the creation of Facebook and much more about the age old themes of betrayal revenge ambition and greed The opening scene sets the tone perfectly It is late 2003 and Harvard University student and computer genius Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg is being dumped by his girlfriend It is clear from Eisenberg s portrayal and Aaron Sorkins distinctively brilliant dialogue that this is not the most likable of leading men yet somehow as the film progresses we find ourselves rooting for him Returning to his dorm Zuckerberg writes a spiteful entry on his blog about his ex and then creates a website called Facemash by hacking into the college databases and stealing photos of female students to allow site visitors to rate their attractiveness After causing the Harvard servers to crash Zukerberg is given six months academic probation The fuse has been lit though and inadvertently he has caught the attention of several influential figures most notably the Winklevoss twins and their business partner Divya Narendra who approach him with their idea for a social media site With financial backing from his best friend Eduardo Savarin Zuckerberg creates what he calls thefacebook With his business partners kept in the dark about its launch a bitter legal wrangle ensues The courtroom scenes are interspersed throughout the film and having relocated to California and cut his ties with Savarin Zuckerberg and his team watch the newly renamed Facebook grow in strength culminating in its first one million members Eisenberg is excellent as Zukerberg a young man consumed with ruthless ambition and not prepared to let anything stand in his way Superbly scripted directed and acted the film defied all preconceptions and was a success both critically and at the box office going on to win three academy awards and three Baftas Recommended Martin Davis Retrospect Film on Facebook,9
28 June 2020,"A fast, fun and somewhat dark watch",There s this small lapse when I turn off the player remain seated on my chair or couch and just reflect on what I experienced I felt there was some twist some drama that went missing that it was too straightforward and easy at times Then when I logged on Imdb and started with the review I realized that there couldn t have been more to it it was concise crisp and perfectly cooked golden brown if you will Fincher s portrayal of Zuckerberg is amazing Do you like this guy for he has done Do you hate this guy for what he has done He leaves you vacillating for the entire 2 hours A word of approval for Jesse who was inch perfect in Zuckerberg s shoes He brought out the idiosyncrasies of the person to perfection Most of you already know some of the plot so no spoilers there but it ll still make for a very captivating watch on one of those rainy evenings at home Could this have been done better I doubt it Is it a masterpiece No,7
26 November 2020,The basic 'inspired by true events movie',The whole idea of the movie was quite interesting The acting was pretty good mostly the one of Jesse Eisenberg who really did a good job of portraying Mark Zuckerberg The script was fine but i found the way scenes were presented to be sometimes weird Overall the movie was great and it had some amazing parts It won 3 Oscars and it really deserved these awards but there was a little room for improvement Don t get me wrong I definitely enjoyed watching it and it tells a story that many people do not know about Mark Zuckerberg is the man that we all see as the image of Facebook but as we discover in the film there were a lot of people behind these huge company and the movie does a great job of presenting these manners,8
29 November 2010,A Perfect Movie!,There is always one movie each year that manages to get everything right and The Social Network is that film well it is a David Fincher film From the script to directing the performances and even the music is perfect The film has a great opening and keeps building momentum til the very end The narrative jumps back and forth from Zuckerberg s case where he is being sued by his former buddies and class mates to all the events that led up to the trial And not one bit of its confusing but its all entertaining Jesse Eisenberg is pretty much Jesse Eisenberg in every role but this happens to be the perfect movie for Eisenberg He pull off the nerdy genius guy with ease and adds depth unseen in his other films I guess he finally got some great material to work with Andrew Garfield s Eduardo is the heart of this film while Timberlake s Sean Parker is the film s douche bag The Winklevoss twins offer up some great comedy and both are remarkably played by one actor Armie Hammer The Social Network which makes it possible for me to write this review and share it with you all is fun intriguing and a genius piece of film making It is the best movie I ve seen this year so far and will definitely walk away with a few Oscars Don t miss it for more no nonsense honest thoughtful reviews check out THE TICKING TICKET is the movie worth your time http tickingticket blogspot com,10
18 September 2022,"A BEAUTIFUL BLEND OF GREAT STORY, PHENOMENAL ACTING WITH A DARK TONE",This movie is completely in Fincher style If you are fan of previous Fincher movies then you are in to a magnificent story telling with some dark tone First of all we have to give loud applause to Aaron sorkin for giving such a great script And coming to cast all actors did a fantastic job technically this is brilliant In this film music is like ice on the cake it s really suits for movie tone Coming to director David Fincher man this guy is really son of a gun the command he have in craft is indescribable He gave another classic to the film lovers all over the world And finnally I m goind finish my review by one note THIS IS REALLY A DIFFERENT BIOGRAPHY WHICH WE ALL SHOULD SEE FEEL IT,8
28 August 2011,"One of the rare movies, that show programming realistic, but far from boring",Programming doesn t sound very interesting does it Maybe with a few fictional twists that make it more appealing and understandable to the general public but it is really hard to realistically explore the world of computer magic and make it so entertaining as in The Social Network The plot follows the creation of the social network website Facebook while also jumping in time forward to the lawsuit against Facebook s creator Mark Zuckerberg The Social Network isn t just a drama about programming and lawsuits but also a story of friendship love and betrayal The Social Network has a lot of great points so it is tough to pick out the best of them Firstly it has one of the best acting ensembles ever seen Not just the Oscar nominated Jesse Eissenberg also Andrew Garfield Armie Hammer and surprisingly Justin Timberlake are all outstanding and add a great plus to the movie The writing and directing is also amazing telling the story in an unique intelligent and entertaining while the stunning dialogs that simply explode out of the actor s mouths are only even better with the great actors Of course there are also te two other Oscar winning elements The music and the editing Both are great especially the score s main theme and one of the most epic scenes of past years The Royal Regatta scene In short The Social Network won t entertain only people who use Facebook and are interested in programming but practically anyone who knows a good drama when he sees one,
5 August 2021,This is USA,For better and worse this movie represents America The ability to create free enterprise the internet without having a dollar to your name you can use these things to make yourself a millionaire But we all know being a millionaire isn t cool anymore What is also inherently American is to take someone else s idea and improve upon it with or without their consent Though what follows will likely be a lawsuit another American tradition,10
12 September 2022,David Fincher's Best!,Possibly my second favorite movie ever The story may have fictional based plot points to better fit the narrative and themes but mixed with snappy and flawless direction a literally start to finish quotable screenplay by Aaron Sorkin refreshing and emotional performances with Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield as genuine standouts and near perfect scenes from start to finish somehow make this more revisit able than Fight Club which I also enjoyed thoroughly I have my own small issues like a few weird points in the script and Justin Timberlake only giving a decent performance on the back of the director but overall one of the most exciting and personally poignant films I ve ever seen Deserves a focused watch at least once for everyone,9
21 January 2020,Informative and capturing film,Overall in purely film terms this film was great Great storytelling and great acting all round And as a minor point it s a text book example of a great last shot in a film Nothing deep but just gets you thinking about something other than money at the moment the film closes My only fault with the film is that I wouldn t have made it at all So it turns out that Mark Zucherberg became the youngest billionaire ever by being extremely selfish That s probably not a surprise but the one good thing about Mark Zucherberg the one thing that redeems him from creating social media is that he could be an inspiration for young people to strive for success through education rather than through bullying Maybe Mark should be exposed as a bad person however in this case I think the better thing for humanity would actually be to keep that behind closed doors and let him at least be an inspiration for the next generation to work harder at school,8
23 October 2010,"""Fight Club"" for Facebook users.",The Social Network is one of those films that is rare in its ability to spark conversation When the film ends you can t help but turn to your friend or family member and instantly start talking about what you saw The film tells the story of Mark Zuckerburg the 24 year old who created Facebook and is now a billionaire Intertwined with the site s creation are scenes showing Mark getting sued by his best friend as well as other business partners The actors in this film aren t too well known except Justin Timberlake But all actors do a phenomenal job You are sucked into the story and forget you re seeing a film You think you re seeing the actual events occur Its that believable Jesse Eisenberg who plays Mark really shines in his role Justin Timberlake is good also The writing is particularly good All characters are unique in voice Dialog is quick as it can be in real life The film is directed by David Fincher who gave us Fight Club Now of course The Social Network doesn t have blood or strange twists But Mr Fincher has seemed to recreate the visual style of Fight Club The most notable similarity is the film s musical score While composed by different artists than Fight Club it is a non traditional score The music is like a playlist for a college party thus emulating the college atmosphere If you are a Facebook user this film should be on your list to see In the theaters You will not be disappointed The film s last scene is genius having a moral revealed to the audience and is so relatable to many Facebook users The film s only downfall is its length I found it to be a tad long But other than that this film is top notch and will have you thinking and will cause your jaw to drop at the final cut to black,9
17 June 2019,Could have been better than that !!!,Of course the main idea of the movie is a biography and it s a fact but I do not know the details of the story written for this film are really close to reality and truth however although the whole of movie is good but drama in the film does not go well and does not affect feelings,6
21 April 2021,One of the best biography so far!!,One of the best biography so far based on Mark Zuckerberg The social network is a masterpiece the way it s execute is just amazing watch it now guys,10
5 September 2020,It's not about Facebook,Yes mark zucceeburg creates Facebook in this movie but dig a little deeper There are so many themes hidden in this movie you just have to look for them,10
30 January 2021,Perfect,This is a perfect film A completely flawless cinematic masterpiece that is Fincher s best work to date,10
5 March 2021,Good film...the first time you watch it...,This is a very well crafted film and i understand why David Fincher made it he s a great director in my opinion however when you break it down it s simply about a bunch of spoiled rich kids arguing over money Good film but i don t see myself rewatching this one again anytime soon,5
18 October 2010,A rebel with a laptop,The Social Network is a fascinating look at the creation and legal dilemmas surrounding the ever present Facebook The film moves at a lightning fast pace covering a multitude of relationships legal issues messages and themes The filmmakers took a true story and used it as a backdrop to reflect on our current social hierarchies When I first heard about this film I didn t really see a compelling story It felt more like a 60 Minutes interview than anything else but leave it up to a great script and strong director to visualize this computer orientated material Typically director David Fincher won t tackle a project unless it has a buzz on it so hot it drops on the lap of every major agent in Hollywood I wasn t sure how the filmmakers were going to setup the dramatic arch of such a computer bound narrative and then it hits you twenty minutes into the film reveal the story slightly out of chronological order based on the specific legal elements I m not saying it wouldn t be fascinating to watch the eventful rise and fall of a young adult s hubris in the order it actually happened but sometimes a narrative works a little better if the structure is tweaked crafted in a way that better serves the character dynamics I m not going to lie a second viewing won t hurt The combination of intelligent argumentative dialogue and thematic understandings of success is so layered I m sure I missed out on a few important messages Sometimes when you tend to focus on how well a film is shot and crafted it s hard to concentrate on the details of the story along with the rapid fire dialogue The Social Network follows the cynical somewhat misanthropic computer rebel Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg who created one of the largest computer websites in the world His best friend and Harvard roommate Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield is his so called partner in funding and establishing his new website Along the way to success Zuckerberg befriends a Californian connection Sean Parker Justin Timberlake who invented the widely used Napster music program According to the film Zuckerberg stole the Facebook idea from two buffed out Harvard elite twins and cheated them on their original idea This and many other legal infringements lead to a multimillion dollar lawsuit This goes to show you when the economy is down and a lot of money is involved friendships will be betrayed egos will be conflicted and entitlement will be the name of the game Jesse Eisenberg a strong Jewish looking actor pinpoints this character as much as he nails the timing of the razor sharp dialogue He understands this young ambitious individual Zuckerberg really isn t a bad guy or as rebellious as he comes off He s a man of strong principles even when those principles betray the ones around him He believes that the one who created is the one who is credited Well in this fiercely competitive American society where lawyers agents and government officials run the game Zuckerberg is really just a pawn Even when his points come across as valid there are certain principles in society which undermine his own and the only way to save his reputation is to play the game his own lawyers conduct When all is said and done Zuckerberg is still just a young man who wants to be accepted He comes off as a rebel but in a key scene where his new party animal friend Sean Parker gets arrested at a frat party his image is suddenly tarnished We finally see that his reputation means a lot more than his credit This is a prime example as to why this character works it s three dimensional and by the end Zuckerberg s personality backfires on the audience s expectations I think one of the film s strongest themes is social elitism The film questions the importance of elitism in a university which is bound to its social upbringing more so than a student s GPA at least I speculate In the scene where the Harvard twins are in a rowboat competition at a prestigious English school director Fincher blurs out the edges of the frame in certain close up shots The rowboat scene is understated by Trent Reznor s lead singer for Nine Inch Nails tantalizing and operatic score which goes to show you that music can reveal a whole new level to a scene The overall understanding I received from that masterly shot and edited scene is that Fincher is both revealing and mocking the students focal point and sheer determination to be accepted in Harvard s elite social circle This is as far as I m going to delve into the narrative As you can see it covers a lot of ground and David Fincher s craft is in top form Checkout The Social Network and I guarantee you ll have your own thematic understanding of this entertaining true story,8
19 December 2011,Well Made but Flawed,A movie about Facebook Really This is what I was thinking when I first heard about this film Thankfully after viewing my opinion changed Director David Fincher has pulled off a very well made film thanks to the story dialog and the acting Jesse Eisenberg plays Mark Zuckerberg a student at Harvard University who has begun work in his college dorm with his roommate to make Facebook a social networking website in which users can create a personal profile and connect with other users However lawsuits arise that accuse Zuckerberg of stealing the idea from another group of students As the site continues to grow Mark meets Sean Parker a very successful entrepreneur Mark beings to gravitate more towards Sean leaving his roommate behind Overall I really enjoyed the film It was engaging intelligent and above all fresh The acting was phenomenal Jesse Eisenberg truly comes off as a witty college kid Justin Timberlake who played Sean Parker does a terrific job in a fairly clich d role as well However I felt that the film s biggest downfall was the portrayal of Zuckerberg Although he is humorous and intelligent he ultimately was egotistical and arrogant From the opening scene he comes off in my opinion as very unlikeable someone who really needs to take a class on thinking before speaking So for the entire film I often found myself rooting for his roommate a much more down to earth guy as opposed to Zuckerberg So yeah I enjoyed the film but if I was the real life Mark Zuckerberg I would not be pleased with my portrayal,8
19 June 2011,"Great script, great leading actor",Again greatness from Sorkin Well deserved Oscar for screenplay The movie is fast intelligent messy as life itself But it keeps you alert involved and wanting for more The direction by Fincher is secure and the camera captures nerdness and energy in subtle takes The choice of Jesse Eisenberg for the leading role is perfect Hoodie complex sentences utter disregard for others feelings Zuckerberg is THE nerd probably creating thus a brave new idol to emulate by the current youth besides the pernicious sports stars and hopeless musicians Great and memorable character The dialogue is perky irreverent watch the opening scene and the school board scene delicious the action is fast and relevant and the whole makes a rewarding experience As an aside Timberlake does not fully convince and beside the great acting by Eisenberg the rest of the cast is not at the same altitude Read my other reviews at  sites google com site dan4gabriel home,8
7 January 2011,You'd have to be slightly nerdish to like it.,Yup I m one of those people that liked it but wasn t flabbergasted like most other people I still don t get why I m pulling the short straw statistic wise though Let s face it movies are not documentaries unless the story behind them is really and I DO mean REALLY good This is just a story following money and nerds Sure there s emotion there you ll have to sit through a large chunk of the movie before being able to detect it and sure there s a good story there but are you really interested in it or is this one of those less and less frequent success story searching I wish I was him stories It s probably me but I loathe the psychology behind this scheme Look folks read financial history and check how many heroes an antagonists could have been created on this movie s meager standards If you re really interested in the story behind FaceBook then this movie is a must If you like good movies though then this is one you ll be happy to have left alone for a few years Wikipedia is in my humble opinion a more interesting source in this case,4
22 October 2010,Blooming Brilliant,To be honest not a film I was anticipating at all But after watching i feel it to be one of the best films I ve seen this year there s lots of brilliant acting from Jesse Eisenberg Andrew Garfield and surprisingly Justin Timberlake Overall a very interesting movie about the rise of facebook even more interesting as i am a Facebook member making the film have a more personal touch to a wide variety of audiences i can not express how good the film is without giving anything away about the movie as i strongly suggest that you go out and watch it a must see for anyone and everyone of any age and any preference of genre,9
3 October 2010,Money Never Buys Happiness,This movie begins with future billionaire Mark Zuckerberg talking to Erica Albright a ficticious Boston University undergrad who Zuckerberg was currently dating After insulting her education he was a Harvard undergraduate among other things she calls him an asshole breaks up with him and leaves Erica ultimately played a huge part in the story Led by a fury of fast talking dialogue and witty pacing there is not much to dislike about The Social Network The actors are fine suited in their parts with Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg founder of the social network Facebook Andrew Garcia as Eduardo Saverin and Justin Timberlake as the scandalous Sean Parker The film mostly takes place from fall 2003 to the reaching of 1 million Facebook users switching between then to a lawsuit in 2007 against Zuckerberg The ending is a partially sad one due to him losing his best and only friend To me that is what it means about money not buying happiness,9
20 May 2020,PHP CODE ahed,Nice cinematic special the tilt shift like focus effect on Henley Sequence amazing The editing was cool very amusement The soundtrack oh yeah those synths This film so entertaining and funny for anyone especially for programmers,9
14 April 2012,It shouldn't work.... but it does.,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,8
21 November 2010,Fantastic Movie!,The movie delves deep into the origins of the social networking phenomenon There may arise at few points doubts concerning the credibility or the authenticity of the material put together on screen and those are highly debatable but I went in to watch the movie less informed in that department and found it otherwise quite intense and immersive The pacing and the screenplay are wonderful The background score by Trent Reznor Atticus Ross infuses life into the already strong performances spearheaded by Andrew Garfield and Jesse Eisenberg One of the two is certainly going home with an Oscar next year David Fincher takes you on a frenetically paced ride into the world behind facebook with fascinating revelations and disclosures Though the facts portrayed seem to be relevant and are combined in sorts to make the movie exciting and gripping reality somewhat may have been less dramatized and banal The movie scores highly on the performances screenplay background score and direction Superbly executed extremely well made a must watch,9
28 February 2011,Great Movie!!!,Great movie I just loved it Actually it inspired me to create my own unique local social network site for Gibraltar GIBBOOK COM Launched just 3 months ago it already has over 750 members and working really well Who knows I might be doing a movie of GibBook one day too I really love the part where he runs from a friends gathering to his room just because he had an idea Reminds me very much of myself think of something and its gotta be done straight away Don t leave for tomorrow what you can do today The actors are really good too however are they telling the real story of how Mark is I guess that they have to make it more exciting and spice it up by bending the story a bit Who cares it worked well,10
9 March 2011,More Than Face-Value,I admit I fell in love with The Social Network It was smart funny and sympathetic I liked it so much I watched it thrice even though I was sitting for my GCSE A Levels The Social Network is not just a snarky narrative about awkward and rich young men It is also a portrait of human nature as we learn how to grapple with self identity On screen the characters spar with their wit and their lawyers off screen we are left wondering how much authenticity is masked by their defensiveness I adored The King s Speech for it s sheer humanity the latter made me cry while the former made me laugh The King s Speech appears to be the better of the two in my extremely subjective opinion because I was laughing and crying WITH the characters while I was probably laughing AT the characters in The Social Network Nonetheless this movie made me a converted Aaron Sorkin fan He ranks next to Alan Bennett the wonderful British playwright who wrote The History Boys Perhaps like The History Boys I would learn to outgrow The Social Network with all its awkward charm and angst However it was a profound movie that made me question issues that plague our lives today why we are driven to success and why we seek to escape from ourselves to hide from our own darkest shadows,8
31 October 2010,Inspirational story but imperfectly packaged.,On seeing the trailer initially I thought who the hell thought about making a movie about Facebook Yet after discussing it with friends I thought it was worth a try and seeing another trailer made me warm to the idea of going As someone with Asperger s as Zuckerberg is portrayed without a name for the personality traits in the movie it is an inspiration tale of an Aspie doing something with their talents and also it s great to see him being so AS and yet not caring too much college has brought me a lot of anxiety on that one so it was therapeutic to see someone with more confidence in a movie Aside for the therapeutic happy tone of the movie for me I find the film making does leave a bit to be desired The long legal scenes are extremely tedious however I guess there wasn t any way to make the movie without emphasising that aspect of setting up Facebook Thankfully the vignette technique made it more bearable and the dialogue in the college scenes made the characters really endearing and it was good to watch Overall if you re interested in tales of creativity and can put up with some tedious elements of the film then it s worthy cinema night choice for someone who is interested in these kinds of stories I don t know if it ll go down as a classic or not for me it s brilliant but only in some elements of it,7
2 March 2011,"Possibly the best of 2010; ""The Social Network"" is a directorial knock-out as well as a spectacularly written masterpiece. I loved it.",I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,9
6 January 2022,Great story about Success,It s a great story about young people that started the future of social life I don t know does the whole story matches up but I do think that in general this pretty much covers it up I am really satisfied with portrayals of main characters and also pleasantly surprised with acting all three main actors The lesson is pretty much on the cover of the movie It is impossible to become that much successful without making some enemies even if you are not a bad person In the end you can say that Mark made a good call for almost every decision The people who are watching this movie years from that moment they can vouch for that,8

22 May 2021,A truly amazing movie,Not a Masterpiece but probabile one of the best movie of the decade Incredible acting directing and scripting A marvelous true story telling in the best watch possibile A must watch movie one of the best of Fincher s career not the best Zodiac and Fight club are far bitter and I prefer agone girl but the last one is anyway maybe at the same level of the social network,9

23 March 2020,THIS IS PURE ART,Wow just wow I was in complete awe after seeing this film so I decided to scribble something to honour this beautiful picture The Social Network is an outstanding film because of its TOP NOTCH SCREENPLAY brilliant performances by the actors and a masterclass direction by David Fincher Usually I don t pay attention to scores when watching a movie but this film s incredible score was able to grab my attention The alchemy between Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield was very natural which was one of the highlights of the film This film was an emotional rollercoaster of which I enjoyed every bit of it Thank you David Fincher THIS IS PURE ART,10
27 October 2020,Amazing work!!!!,David Fincher and whole team has done a master piece of work in this film They upgraded the work sense of every human being through this movie they change the thinking of everyone for working in big multinational companies Hats off David one no 1 film,10
24 June 2011,"Amazing story, not very well directed",The real story was well worth telling its truly one of theft betrayal greed ego and consequential money loneliness and emptiness This film shows Mark Zuckerberg mr Facebook to be the low life that he is and for that the film is definitely worth a watch it becomes increasingly addictive My wife and my just found the boring background music too high in volume and we spent most of the time having to read subtitles to be able to follow the dialog We are not deaf we have never had this problem with other films so why does the director David Fincher spoil the viewer experience with such an unnecessary inconvenience We got the impression that David Fincher is a Spike Lee wannabe and this spoiled what could have been a far better film That said the acting was good enough to make it well worth two hours of your time,5
23 January 2011,Sensory Overload,Have you ever had the feeling of being watched not only by your best friend but your neighbor long lost cousin and the kid you randomly met last night I have and Facebook is the reason Now don t get me wrong I was ecstatic my freshman year in high school when I received the email informing me I had been invited to Facebook well TheFacebook at the time Away with Myspace and hello to endless clicking on the mouse for hours at a time Facebook offers an inside look into your friends personal life creating sensory overload if you use it too much The majority of people even my Grandma in Canada have Facebook and I found myself realizing I could not get away from it I along with millions have to check Facebook every chance I get and with technological advances it became easier and accessible through cell phones What is it that makes a person so anxious when typing in their password to login if it has t already been auto saved I ll tell you what is it it s that little red caption box under notifications informing you on wall post photo comments and whatever it is that a friend did relating back to your account Facebook creates an unspoken language for communicating through a software that understands you because of your interaction with the website The Social Network leaves viewers feeling like one of the creators alongside Mark and his colleagues The dramatic music symbolism and excellent acting makes for a compelling plot The movie gives you an inside look at the creation of a billionaire and his company Can you even fathom 6 9 billion that s Marks estimated net worth The movie takes you through every detail of the creation of Facebook and the ridiculous lawsuits against the site It shows how pathetic and greedy some are for the sake of money The movie exposes how fast and popular the site became in a matter of months and the cleverness of one Harvard student If anything one might be disappointed when the credits begin to roll because it s one of those movies you don t want to end Although the movie has ended everyone watching is wondering the same thing what s next for Facebook and will it ever end After watching The Social Network twice and being completely fascinated by Facebook I decided to deactivate my Facebook account I couldn t get away from it and watching the movie made me realize this After six devoted years on the site I ve decided to take a break from Facebook and see how interacting with friends is different because I m not connected with them threw a website This was an AWESOME movie and I recommend it to any who has a pulse and knows how to use a computer,10
23 January 2011,The most praised movie of 2010. But is it deserving?,When previews for The Social Network began running in theaters many people wrote this movie off as the facebook movie but it has now become one of the most acclaimed movies of the year and perhaps the decade This movie follows the young creators of facebook during their college years and throughout their invention s rise in popularity The two largest roles would be Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin played by Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield respectively Both of these young actors deliver outstanding performances with Eisenberg easily putting in the best work of his career Andrew Garfield is some what of a new face in America but this role is a wonderful way for our audiences to get to know him before he takes on being the new Spider Man The most surprising performance comes from Justin Timberlake who has already shown he can survive in the music world but he seems to be turning into a rather promising actor The real star of this movie would have to be the script written by Aaron Sorkin with it s witty speedy dialogue this movie seems to be in a whole different league than most other current films Director David Fincher also puts forth his best work with this movie since Fight Club which came out nearly eleven years earlier Although the movie is primarily about the creation of facebook that only begins to scratch the surface It really provides a story of a person who is so determined to be known for something and will not stop at nothing to earn his recognition It provides a good portrait of the current generation because we have the ability to create anything and post it on the internet to be seen by the world This movie deals with the sacrifices Zuckerberg has to deal with in order to be seen,8
26 January 2011,Hyped to the max,There was a great deal of hype about this movie I was sucked in I watched it last night It was a good movie However I watched Black Swan earlier that day and I think that both that movie and Inception were in a different league to The Social Network in terms of concept and execution The film offered an engaging insight into the machinations of Facebook s launch and subsequent growth supported by excellent performances from the cast of relative unknowns I expected it to use that central story to focus on the tragedy of the split in the friendship between the two founders It didn t and I m not sure why I think there was a lack of real emotion behind the slick facade of this movie I might be in the minority but I think it would be a travesty if The Social Network won best picture,7
1 June 2011,The new pulp fiction!,Across the history of cinema some of the most impactful and cult movies have had a few things in common Their stories have surrounded a real world phenomena and the direction captured the essence of the story better than reality The Social Network by all means is the cult classic of this generation What happens when you put the combination of a story writer who has the expertise to convert real world stories into a even more powerful screenplay Charlie Wilson s War Few Good Men and a director with the most astute skills of story telling Fight Club Seven The Game on a single project The social network is nothing short of an explosive ride the pace of which will keep you on your toes and the dialogues will make you applaud consistently as it all unfolds There is no suspense no killer in the end or no treasure to be found yet it will keep you engrossed and remind you of the world around us Its true that Aaron Sorkin had more than plenty for the story from the book but it takes someone like him to make the movie look better than the book And for David Fincher he made fight club look casual with this Every scene including the background music locations costumes and the look of the characters is nailed to perfection and it gets better than a courtroom drama without a court or the setting The characters are the heart and execute the roles with solid punch and timing Mark Zuckerberg can take lessons from Jesse Eisenberg on how to be Mark Zuckerberg in case he gets too busy and forgets what he was like Jesse Eisenberg was born with this voice and speed of talk for this movie as he single handedly runs with the show through out the movie Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake put in solid performances and even the Winklevoss twins are better than the real ones Every bit of detail has been meticulous worked including the setting of Harvard and code that you see vaguely on the computer screens Above all the dialogues of this drama are the most memorable and will continue to hit on you even with repeated watches Nothing in this movie is extraordinary yet everything about it is a treat to watch Cut to the chase this is the new pulp fiction,
1 February 2011,The Social Network - it's Oscar Time!,I folks Saw the Social Network a little while back and so far I m with all of the experts who think that it is a shoe in for the Oscar Great movie that speaks to people of all ages given the rise of the internet and the social interaction on it To take a guy who was in my view virtually unknown and throw him into the role of the youngest self made Billionaire was a great coupe He was Zuckerberg based on all of the information that we have about him It also showed an intense business side to how quickly you can lose potential life long friends by being in business with them,9

27 August 2014,a story how Facebook began,Through watching this film I can understand how the Facebook started however I was slightly shocked because the reason Mike established this system in Harvard University wasn t good It s kind of ranking system As for me his action wasn t permissive Anyway he s a clever business man considering everything As the advertisement says you don t get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies This message represents his way to promote his company I suppose We might not be able to get everything in order to make a great success Jesse Eisenberg who plays Mark Zuckerberg mimics Mark s way to speak He speaks so fast that I cannot follow all of his lines,6

4 October 2010,Authentically Amazing,When watching The Social Network the first thing that jumps out at you is the dialog It is so fast paced and witty it barely leaves you any room to breathe The second thing that jumps out at you is the amazing quality of the film and it wasn t even shot on film The Social Network was shot on a Red One Video camera The cinematography was flawless and mesmerizing The acting fit perfectly and the soundtrack was superb The movie itself however is not flawless It does drag on at times and the ending was a bit abrupt it seemed But the sheer quality and importance this film holds more than makes up for those minor setbacks The most powerful performance came from the lead Jesse Eisenberg His strong on screen presence was undeniable He commanded the attention in every scene he was in and drew us closer and closer to understanding this very complicated person Overall The Social Network is the third best movie of the year behind Inception and Toy Story 3 and I expect it to clean house at the Oscars,8
23 June 2019,Hated the main character,Ruins the hole movie for me Impossible for someone to be like that extremely obnoxious and trashy,4
28 August 2011,One of the most overrated ever!,All I can say about The Social Network talented but wasted actors Garfield and Eisenberg and director no plot at all a full of clich s about the youth of nowadays bad politic and judicial approach Such a beautiful soundtrack made by a musical genius that this movie really don t deserve another wasted element in a piece that have nothing to say just a common story with common speech I think that The Social Network reveals a not innovative way of marketing and divulgation of Facebook belittling what CINEMA really means It s just a movie for facebookaholics with some curiosities about how to make profits with no scruples,2
29 August 2021,Amazing!,Loved every second that I ve watched totally recommend,10
30 December 2021,my prada's at the washers,I d say that the vast majority of this movie was interesting because of the recurring colour palette by Fincher and the tongue in cheek snarky dialogue by Sorkins and oscar worthy acting by Eisenberg That being said it won three oscars and that is it Did not give it a 10 because at times it wasn t as sleek as excpected and got bland Overall great cinematic experience,9

26 June 2023,"""A million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool? A billion dollars.""",After being best known for crime thrillers out of David Fincher s career a biopic drama about a guy from Harvard who became a billionaire by creating one of the most successful websites on the internet is something out of the bloom With terrific dialogue from a great screenplay written by Aaron Sorkin there s amazing chemistry between every single character present on screen whether they have small roles or big roles that all serve a purpose for the film s runtime The film also teaches how power between business and friendship can lead to the divine and make each other corrupt with the balance of humor and drama in one subject matter The film wastes no time with every little moment that shines with the ideas behind Facebook the lawsuits the start of the business and of course the chemistry between characters such as Mark Jesse Eisenberg and Eduardo Andrew Garfield The film is nothing but smart genius and wise enough to follow its own rules and structures of biopic storytelling making it one of David Fincher s best in the past decade,10

7 February 2011,Need to be in the right mood to watch,Well just finished watching this film and didn t really click with it that well It could have been a lot more fascinating than it was The casting was good but not great the scripting was as you would expect with mentions of web programming terminology server hardware and general geeky use of language but I guess I just wasn t in the right mood for it It only really picked up when Timberlake s character steps in The comedy aspect of the film was pretty average and the lead character did come across as a little too 2 dimensional for my liking All in all not in my top 5 or top 10 It won t make me want to watch a film about the founders of twitter or my space if anyone writes a script for them too But in fairness it wasn t the worst film I ve ever seen It just didn t keep me that interested Maybe it s a grower,6
1 October 2010,A modern classic,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,9

9 October 2010,One of the best films of the year!,The Social Network stars Jesse Eisenberg who plays Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg in his college days at Harvard less than a decade ago When we meet him it is difficult to believe that he was working on a multibillion dollar idea At the time Zuckerberg was more concerned with girls and joining exclusive fraternities than developing his unrealized potential The origin of Facebook begins when three students approach Zuckerberg to design a social network site for fellow Harvard students He then enlists financial help of his best friend named Eduardo Saverin played by the impressive Andrew Garfield As soon as the new site is launched the battle for control of Facebook begins I went into this film very sceptical about how this subject matter could translate into film And then I realized that the film is more about the control both financial and influential over the social network website that claims over 500 million members And this is where screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and director David Fincher get it right The Social Network plays out more like a sequel to Wall Street The film s great strength is its compelling drama Fincher shot the film in short scenes that transition flawlessly one to the next The screenplay packs several good lines that act as comedic relief But what works best is the tension that unfolds in front of your eyes The performances are terrific all around particularly Jesse Eisenberg who should get a best actor nomination Justin Timberlake gives an excellent performance as Sean Parker co creator of now defunct file sharing website Napster who takes Zuckerberg as a prot g The film gave me a feeling of disgust It is difficult to like any of the characters in this film From the frat boy mentality of Zuckerberg s fellow Harvard students to the superficiality of Shawn Parker there are not many sympathetic characters in this film But that is exactly why you will be taken in by this film It evokes so much raw emotion that it will keep you enthralled for its entirety It is rare to find a film that is flawless on every level and the Social Network falls into that category The academy I am sure will take note of this The Social Network I am sure will be given a host of nominations,9
8 March 2014,Truthful movie about people's relationships,21st century can t be 21st century without Internet And Internet is not Internet without social networks Nowadays every single person from little kids to old grandparents use Facebook More than a billion people have an account there This website turned the world on 180 degrees Everybody knows who is Mark Zuckerberg the founder of Facebook the most popular website on the Earth And now imagine that creator of Fight Club will make a movie about him And you will get The Social Network the triumphant return of the great director David Fincher I never liked the idea of biopic genre all movies in that expect A Beautiful Mind are bad But The Social Network changed my opinion about that Almost every single detail of the picture is perfect Fincher know how to do everything perfectly and how to keep audience at the screens throughout the film One of my favorite things in the movie is the work of cinematographer I enjoyed his shooting style and how he competently picked frames I think it is one of the best cinematographer s work I have ever seen Also hard work of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin is magnificent the film literally can disassemble the citations But my favorite thing is cast Brilliant acting play of Jessie Eisenberg struck me and made me change an opinion about him into the positive way Also work of Andrew Garfield I liked very much he did really good and from this moment for me he is not only associated with Spider Man Besides positive moments this picture has some problems Sometimes the film sags and loses rhythm but fortunately it happens for a couple minutes and then the picture starts to grow again Very well chosen slogan You can t get 500 million friends without making a few enemies this movie not only about creating Facebook but also about human relationships Usually when someone achieves something really big other people begin to envy him It happens always and especially in huge businesses And it also happened to Mark Zuckerberg everybody wanted to be in deal with him to earn tons of money And also I can add very good phrase to this movie Old friends and old vine are best about conflict of two best friend Mark and Eduardo Money always make people worse and even best friends can become total enemies cause of that I think The Social Network is a brilliant movie and almost everything about it is perfect It is very inspiring story that really convinces to do something I liked it a lot,10

11 January 2022,Interesting!,Well about this movie I can t say a lot that hasn t been said yet BUT even if I am not a D Fincher fan I can say with confidence that this movie is extremely well done the directing style the soundtrack combined with the flashbacks the intriguing screenplay and the realistic and accurate acting So good Then this movie isn t just a biopic it is even a story about friendship betrayal and envy You will probably see Facebook in a different way after watching The social Network It is a movie that probably could interest everyone,10
11 February 2021,An excellent movie to know more about the background,It is interesting to know about the beginning of one of the most famous social networks in the world The hidden facts that are revealed show us an interesting perspective and can generate interesting and productive discussions with the others who watched it Definitely a good choice if you like a mix between documentary and a normal movie,9
30 December 2021,Terrific 🔥,Will definitely hit you hard Must give it a try The conversation between the employees of giant tech companies were so good and so knowledgeable Also the facts they are putting infront of us so bravely really appreciated You will definitely learn a lot from here Also the story which is going side by side is so relatable I am totally amazed Good work,9
1 October 2010,Masterfully crafted character piece,The Social Network is a character piece about the man who created a website which more than 500 million people currently use and the relationships destroyed along the way Set through scenes paralleling two legal suits the film follows the founding of Facebook but more importantly person behind it The film begins as Zuckerberg arrives to his dorm after his girlfriend breaks up with him He sits down and writes the formula for facemash com which ultimately shuts down Harvard s server and gets him recognized After meeting with the Winklevoss Twins he agrees to write a formula for a social network which he sets aside while he creates Facebook Jessie Eisenburg stars as Mark Zuckerberg a Harvard student who lets success go to his head Fueled by jealousy and greed Zuckerberg is willing to destroy his relationship with Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield just to be known The Social Network had a great sense of character which is fleshed out through an expertly crafted script Arron Sorkin writes a film so in depth understanding and witty it truth is painful An understanding is had that Zuckerbeg is also a kid who wants to be know David Finchers notoriously meticulous direction gives nothing but the best performances from all the actors involved in the film While providing standard Fincher elements the camera goes through a railing and a window the film also show Fincher at the top of his career ex the rowing scene Jessie Eisenberg s performance is excellent but the stand out actor is Andrew Garfiel playing Eduardo Saverin Zuckerbergs college friend Sporting an American accent Garfield plays his character so right and his chemistry with Eisenberg is all to real That being said this is the type of movie you watch for performances and every actor gives a noteworthy performance The Social Network stresses that the decisions we make at a young age fueled by jealousy greed rage can have a monumental impact on our futures From http filmwatchreviews blogspot com,10
27 December 2012,One of the best movies of its decade...,An idea is nothing unless you execute it Go ahead and execute it If you have an idea some one will have a better one This is what all The Social Network is all about How a college student created something that has now become almost a necessity of our lives and what is the reality behind the creation of it It clearly exposes the world in which we live world with friends and enemies An excellent direction with some brilliant acting performance by Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield makes this a must watch Crisp Editing awesome screenplay and brilliant music score earned it 3 Academy Awards Jesse Eisenberg is at his best bringing the complete character live on the big screen People will notice how people really are in actual life Its not any fantasy story A pure reality a real world with people having objectives aim and ambition David Fincher achieved another milestone in his career with this awesome creation He is another director along with Christopher Nolan to watch in coming years His other movies like Se7en Fight Club are already among the favorites of the people His awesome work in this film also earned him a nomination in Academy Awards But he did won Golden Globe so did the film in the category Best Motion Picture Drama Clearly one of the best movies of the decade,9
19 October 2011,One of the smartest films I have seen,One of the smartest films I have seen The directing was razor sharp and the acting was just spectacular The story was incredibly interesting and the relevancy it brings to almost every viewer is just short of amazing I can t rave enough about this film The directing leads the way in my grading system To sell a drama about Social Media you would think no big deal Just get some good acting and the actors will sell this film for you After all it is primarily just dialog right In this case the director sells the film foremost and the excellent acting is just a huge bonus The director paced this movie quick and snappy throughout It was edgy and sharp And to keep the engagement pulse as high and constant as this director did was just pure mastery The cast of this film was just a delight to watch The chemistry the energy believability and talent was just plain excellent Kudos to the complete cast Every actor just added a gold star to their body of work Bravo I also must bring up the music in this film Coupled with top directing and good timing background music played a huge role all by itself Well chosen music loops and proper volume behind the scene forced the mood of every important moment and gave it depth and a much bigger presence Along with the main elements of any film this drama also brought something else BIG to the table This was as contemporary as you can get Most people can relate to this film because of the huge success of Facebook However this was not JUST a story about Facebook and its creators dealing with the turmoil of their creation It was also a story of people The story of people behind the scenes of Facebook to be sure but also the story of us We as our kind cannot resist checking in on our neighbors and ourselves We want to know and we want to know right now We contributed everything to this film via our addiction to social media WE made it relevant Facebook was the wall to write it on Now tie all these elements together and you have a film that pulls you in This is one good drama Even if you don t want to have anything to do with the Facebook this film stands on its own just by the story itself and the exceptional directing and acting If you use Facebook you should see this movie If you don t use it I bet you just might sign up after seeing it knowyourmovie blogspot com,

3 June 2019,My favorite film of all time,A Masterwork in nearly every sense David Fincher s The Social Network is a damn near flawlessly movie and is acted directed written scored and edited to perfection One of the best films ever made and will one day be listed with Citizen Kane and The Godfather,10
24 April 2020,A novel experience,Over the years I have fallen in love with David Fincher s creations The taut storylines unconventional characters and above all the unexpected twists had characterised Fincher s films for me The Social Network on the other hand seems to be a deviation from his usual genre of films The movie is again about the background story of one of our beloved websites or applications Naturally this unusual combination was quite intriguing The screenplay at first is quite difficult to follow It makes the viewers keep on guessing about the track that the movie is going to follow Few minutes into the movie the non linear screenplay gradually starts making sense and at the end of two hours it presents us with one of the best storylines or it can be said interchangeably as screenplay in the recent times It tells brilliantly the thought process and actions that had gone behind in establishing one of the successful organisations today which though brilliant and ground breaking is sordid and ruthless in equal parts It is very hard to describe who has put forward the best performance in the film The acting the minimal background music and all other associated acts offer such a continuum of experience it sucks the audience inside and make them feel as a participant of the events that had taken place,9
4 November 2021,One of The Best Biopics Out There,A great example of what a good biopic should be Jesse Eisenberg does a great job on portraying Mark Zuckerberg and the movie makes you feel like you re actually seeing this person in action The film was well paced and never really dragged getting straight to the point This was also by far my favorite performance by Andrew Garfield who might just be my favorite movie Spider man I wish they had a better soundtrack for the movie but it s still pretty good as is Great watch if you re interested in the ins and outs of social media outlets,8
4 December 2021,Impressive,The Social Network is so much more than just the Facebook movie As the title suggests the film is not just about the internet s impact on society but about society itself and the social morays that have been imposed on it It s all about the sting of exclusion and the need for inclusion It s all about measuring one s worth by who they know and what groups they belong to Facebook didn t change the way we live our lives it just made it easier for us to do what we ve been doing for a long long time,9
25 October 2022,#Engaging #Enthralling #Entertaining,A story about invention of Facebook or should I say The Facebook Its a story of an entrepreneur its a story of a brilliant mind story of an opportunist story of a friend A brilliant story line well directed well scripted Acting was brilliant The content was engaging and shows us different aspect of one of the most renowned entrepreneur of our world Mark Zuckerberg From the start of the harvard the peer pressure the competition within friends The college life the idea of having college life over the internet has been perfectly depicted in this movie Would love to have a sequel,8
24 January 2022,the best modern classic i have seen,I am writing a review for the movie The Social Network This movie is really one of the best First of all the actors really fit their characters Jesse Eisenberg represents the main character fully and Andrew Garfield gave an excellent performance as the best friend and even kind of the second main character I cant really believe that he didnt get an oscar for his performance in this movie And Justin Timberlake really did a great job too For a movie that was made 2010 are the sound effect and visual effect really great Everyone who was involved in this movie really outdone theirselve It is also very educational because you learn so much about Facebook and how it was founded I never realy new much about Facebook but now I know so many usefull information In my opinion The Social Network is one of the best movies I have seen in my life and I think it will always be,10
17 November 2021,One of the best David Fincher movies,The film proposes to tell a biography with most of the facts being fictitious and it does it very well the fact that it doesn t follow the facts of real life can be a negative point for some for me it helps to make the story cooler to watch by fact of being more unpredictable The film with excellent dialogues and analogies with current discussions which is another merit of the film it manages to be current even though it was released 11 years ago it is not a dated film even when it comes to a subject that evolves every day technology Great performances especially Jesse Eisenberg I had never seen a movie with him and I managed to get a good impression of him it s no wonder he was nominated for an Oscar for best actor we have other good acts like Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake My final grade is 10 an interesting movie that manages to keep you entertained from beginning to end of the story,10
23 November 2010,Must watch,This movie consists of brilliant performances The screenplay is designed to suit the pace of the movie to cover the whole story in a smart manner It portrays Mark Zuckerberg as a positive character at the end even after doing a lot of wrong things in life He still comes out clean in the end with sympathetic approach This movie has been able to capture the hearts of millions not only that are in Harvard but also of Asian students and European students It has given them a hope to be the owner of some BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY in the future The rich people like Sergey Brin and Larry Page and Bill Gates are in danger There is a new name in the town Mark Zuckerberg Can just one internet site do it and beat Google s all services in terms of revenues yet to be seen Must watch,9

4 November 2010,Fantastic! brilliant true story everyone will relate to :D,From start to finish this film has you hooked constantly its the brilliantly told true story of the social network everyone s heard of Jesse Eisenberg gives yet another amazing performance in a film which seems oddly made for him He fits his character description perfectly and you really believe his role in the story itself Not only is it a great entertaining film of the hard work Mark Zuckerberg went through to get the site up and running and the legal challenges he faced but for any user of Facebook it is great to see the story behind how it came to be such a major part of our lives If your thinking what I was as I entered the cinema is Justin Timberlake going to ruin this movie then you ll be pleasantly surprised He gave a really exciting performance one anyone could enjoy and really understood his character For those of you who love to see large amounts of action in the films then this probably isn t for you but anyone who wants a good entertaining and and fun story with some fantastic performances this really is a MUST SEE Steven Theobald,8
7 October 2010,It made me mad at Oliver Stone,This movie made me angry at Oliver Stone I enjoyed Wall Street 2 and went for his excuse that he didn t hang the bad guys up by their thumbs because paraphrase it s hard to made a compelling moving about CDO s CDS s and synthetic derivatives So he turned in a treacly movie with a love story and on the level of treacly Hollywood movies it s good But The Social Network has an even harder task to make computer coding somehow interesting and just to handicap it it s a true story So you can t just make up a lot of crap you have to follow certain real life plot points and still produce a compelling story And boy does it It s true that there are no likable characters here and how hard must it be to write a screenplay where there s no good guy bad guy dynamic to bounce around but then there didn t have to be in Oliver Stone s film either Heck he could have made everybody purely evil as the first Wall Street managed and taken them down even while producing a financially successful film but he didn t Meanwhile Aaron Sorkin writes dialogue that reverberates like a Gatling gun all the better to showcase the brilliant but socially clueless Zuckerberg as he hurtles past not through human relationships The film doesn t have a car chase an over choreographed bar fight or much more than a few seconds of implied sex yet it s one of the most compelling movies I ve seen this year There are times when you just want to agree with the first female in the film who tells Zuckerberg You are an asshole and you wait for redemption or payback which never comes Yet you can t take your eyes off it Wall Street 2 was a candy confection next to The Social Network That s too bad because Zuckerberg is only one jerk and Wall Street has thousands of them Would that they had gotten a more insistent whipping,10
8 October 2010,Fascinating,I liked this movie a lot Another accidental invention I m guessing that without Sean Parker s inspiration Facebook wouldn t have evolved from where it was Probably someone else would have done it Facebook is a stripped down version of My Space More devoted to the chat room aspect as opposed to having your own website Very good acting all of them seemed involved The strong story helped If I were Zuckerberg I would be flattered Maybe he felt he had to disclaim a few things One of your more interesting and intelligent people One wonders why he isn t in NASA the military or corporate world maybe he consults Facebook has become a bit more than he envisioned I personally see it as a means of expression Nice look at the computer world for the layman Reminded me of PI HACKERS and SNEAKERS very impressed with Eisenberg and Timberlake I liked how the Jessica Albright story tied the film together and gave you perspective as to Zuckerberg s character Like the lawyer tells him you re not as a hole but you try real hard to be Almost like he s trying to emulate some of the people around him He s an obsessive minded programmer who has to take on some of the aspects of corporate chicanery Can t wait until the DVD comes out so I can watch it at my own speed,8
5 October 2010,This film will still be heard about after the Oscars,Flincher and Sorkin seriously made a great team here Flincher provides great filming and takes a real focus on Zuckerberg s internal struggle on decision making Sorkin went over expectations and brings a three way point of view story telling making it all into one and at the same time making it flow as very smoothly This film can easily draw audiences in by presenting a simple plot that people are familiar with and showing one of the greatest events that there is in story making And that is the rise to power Eisenberg does a great job of showing his struggle with power backstabbing and moral obligation It runs a very intelligent course and provides the audience to make its own decisions between right and wrong The Facebook Movie has a deep perspective into this complex story and is perhaps one of the greatest accounts on a true event story of our time This will certainly be mentioned later in the year during the awards season but I believe that even beyond the awards season it will not be the last time we hear about the brilliant story telling of The Social Network,10
23 December 2010,Maybe that's why he won the victory,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,9
22 February 2011,A modern-day Citizen Kane.,This movie is a modern setting Citizen Kane or There Will Be Blood All three films chronicle a genius who sap their humanity and friendship for power And I believe the social network deserves to be among them This movie chronicles the sort of true story of the founding of Facebook Whether or not it s true I don t care Anyways the main character Mark Zuckerberg is a computer genius and I suppose he could be called a nerd but besides the fact that he is smart he is not a nerd at all He is very sure of himself not nervous at all and is powered by anger a very un nerd like trait Anyways some guys say Zuckerberg stole their idea they sue him his best friend sues him and that s basically it in the large scheme of things What s really fascinating is this character s luring into the land of fame and riches above good friends and it s consequences All performances are top notch and believe it or not Justin Timberlake s pretty cool,9
30 August 2018,Not as good or interesting as you'd hope it will be,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,6
5 March 2014,Chilling and cinematically beautiful; a true directory masterwork,The Social Network depicts Mark Zuckerberg s played by Jesse Eisenberg oftentimes legitimately challenged rise to the top The movie is ultimately a drawn out court session in which Zuckerberg and his once best friend Eduardo look back on the past to decipher a long line of fraudulencies all starting with Eduardos investment into thefacebook The Social Networks looks to unveil the brutal struggle for profit what it stems from and whether it was really intentional The acting was impeccable making the tension between Eduardo and Mark almost tangible Justin Timberlakes performance was very impressive and genuinely portrayed Sean Parkers personality in the movie I personally don t know much about his real personality Another familiar face which I managed to recognize with a bit of research was Brenda song in her more serious role known for Zack and Cody The pacing of the movie was amazing The beginning was extremely intriguing and kept me on the edge of my seat The prolonged court session had me trailing of a bit but I guess it was the foundation of the movie The movie had me sympathize with Mark at the beginning but had me doubting his decisions towards the end The movie managed to maintain a relatively neutral viewpoint on what happened between Marks invention of Facebook and it hitting 1 million users and deserves a lot of recognition,9
10 May 2016,An undeniable masterpiece,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,9
12 April 2020,A Must See!,A must see entertaining movie filled with memorable scenes At time I felt more time should have been taken developing the growth of Facebook Overall a must see,7
30 June 2019,More than a movie about facebook,It s so amazing to watch a movie where everything just works The Writing is fantastic and I m not just talking about the dialogue which is incredibly well written but the way it jumps timelines and cross cuts between different lawsuits which brings me to my next point the editing The editing is perfect it always keeps up the pace between actors and the conversations and the acting is also great Jersey isanburg built up enough good will here for me to give him a pass for Batman v Superman and Justin timberlake and Andrew Garfield rock there supporting roles The directing is pitch perfect I don t think that should be a surprise david Fincher always nails the execution Overall this movie is just a marvel to watch It s just amazing to see a movie where everything is firing on all cylinders,10
28 June 2020,"Groudbreaking, clever, and the best film of the decade!",The movie doesn t waste a second every scene has a ton of information to deliver and in every scene Fincher and Soarkin manage to do it with the help of 2 incredible performances this movie lets us choose if Zuckerberg was an as hole or not and makes us wonder what the invention of Facebook means to our society,9
16 November 2020,come on now zuckerberg!,Wow that opening scene This film is quite something not only does it beautifully portray an interesting plot but the acting the acting is quite something Eisenberg s portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg is performed to perfection Amazingly directed by Fincher and written by Sorkin the movie is presented in a very interesting manner This film portrays themes of betrayal trust and university life Definitely worth a watch and one of Fincher s best works,9
23 May 2022,It's not exactly like in the movie,I rated this movie well because I don t give many stars otherwise but I am very dissapointed by Rooney Marra lately as she made a sudden turn in her carrier I really don t feel very well lately being played by her sorry I don t know if this biographic movie includes more or a few female characters into this image I know it happens sometimes even a friend makes me a note that I try to imply a few female characters into one love explanation read with irony about this one sometimes but me myself I don t feel well played by Rooney Marra I think she owes more than explanation on her latest career and she played like something a few movies of biographic type and I am atleast glad that this one is true of its nature and does not lie about some plot or screen play becuase these are biographic movies I d give you more stars for honesty but I don t want you to be to proud of yourself Mark lol Also I think movie is something underrated or not analysed for being after all computer and website movie I think computer films are watched but not enough learned or underestimated in way in all I m sorry I like Magdalena as a friend I have such friend and I think sometimes they can make doctors But I m more like Pontian Pilatos Pontios type and I don t personally think Magdalena can take my role because her mind will not be able to include this,4

31 August 2021,This is what Cinema is.,Mark Zuckerberg I think if your clients want to sit on my shoulders and call themselves tall they have the right to give it a try but there s no requirement that I enjoy sitting here listening to people lie You have part of my attention you have the minimum amount The rest of my attention is back at the offices of Facebook where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room including and especially your clients are intellectually or creatively capable of doing Mark Zuckerberg Did I adequately answer your condescending question Okay I know that the above quatation was quite a substantial read but there is no way that this review is going to be short considering the fact that it is one of the greatest films to have ever been made David Fincher an extraordinary director who had already established himself as one of the greats during the making of this film though this film provided the audience with the exemplary example of how cinema can be much much more than just entertainment but rather serve as a testament of art The Social Network one of the underrated movies of the last decade is a story of a socially unfit 18 year old who wants to be a part of the exclusive culture of Harvard University and in the process to do so ends up making a website which will change life of mankind as we know it Of course the story deals with a lot more than that In spite of keeping its prime focus on Mark Zuckerberg the film spends a lot of its screentime elaboring to us about basic human attributes like ego ambition selfishness jealousy and shows us how even the greatest between us are not free from the seven deadly sins The presence of a distinguished direction furnished by David Fincher carries out the role of the most important element required to make this film what it is But in the end of the day all of it could have gone to waste if not for the musically rhythmic and Shakespeare esque dialogued script provided by the Aaron Sorkin Sorkin has often been referenced with the presence of dialogue which is ostentatiously rapid and clever often with a theatrical speech quality and this movie is an exact presentation of how literally substantial Aaron Sorkin is in the usage of his trademark techniques The Social Network till date is remembered for being one of the best Screenplays to have ever been written The movie although not known for it also has the presence of a seamless cinematography and masterful editing which serve as an important constituent in giving the audience a pleasing experience Lastly the film is also present with several significant prodigious performances and being inspired from real life almost every character is pleasing to observe in spite of the short screentime they are presented with To begin with Jesse Eisenberg provides an exceptional performance as an teenage Mark Zuckerberg who is driven in his journey through greatness just to present himself as an worthy personality in the real world Every action taken by him is done in order to get the approval of strangers and every consequences he faces for that action end up in resulting a degraded relationship with the only people who helped him get through his worst times Eisenberg executes the role of an ambitious egoistic narcissist in the excruciatingly emancipating way possible Then Andrew Garfield accomplishes on what can be argued as the best performance ever carried out by him Him shouting Mark is better than half of the performances ever presented by Marvel Cinematic Universe Justin Timberlake Romney Mara and anyone else present in the film may not have a lot of screenplay to show their hands but are amiable enough performances to view Lastly on a personal note The Social Network was the first example of real cinema ever observed by me This is the movie that made me fall in love with cinema and is a prime specimen of the kind of quintessential cinema that is dying out of the cinematic world today The brilliance present in the making of this cinematic marvel is more than anything we watch today For me this is what cinema is a path towards visual literacy To conclude The Social Network is a great cinema Perhaps the best of it Yet this is not the movie you recommend to people This is for you to find out youself and watch youself alone and cherish that youself selfishly Why I do not know But that s what I did and I never regretted not telling anyone to watch this particular masterpiece People can destroy this film for a cinephile Do not let them,10
4 April 2023,Hand covers bruise....,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,10
19 November 2010,"Even if you're not on Facebook, watch it. If you are, you anyways will.",Now there have been many movies in the past that have shown the back story of a famous phenomenon that affected an entire generation and arguably Facebook is that phenomenon of this generation But what sets The Social Network apart is its complete indifference to the way it portrays the character of Mark Zuckerberg the founder of Facebook By not giving clear reasons for his sort of villainous actions the film leaves it to the viewer to decide and even as the end credits roll even much after that actually you are left with a seeming doubt in mind Hero or Villain For the movie seems to be trying hard to convince the viewer that Mark is both The other major characters of Mark s only friend Edourdo Andrew Garfield and the Napster founder Sean Parker Justin Timberlake are written with clear cut white and dark shades respectively The story behind Facebook as with all great things is actually pretty elemental A break up sets off a turn of events in the life of young Mark Jesse Eisenberg as he sets about creating what would become the world s most famous social networking site As the story proceeds with flashbacks and current happenings we discover the various betrayals and events that shaped Facebook as we know it including how the The got knocked off from Facebook com and what would have been a pretty average story is super enhanced by crackling on your face dialogues that take time for you to register as the film is littered with just so many of them Not only that but the fine restrained performances by all the actors adds a depth to the movie that makes it very realistic The movie may not appeal to some sections of the audience simple because the movie s progress is strictly verbal and there is nothing else to support the movie except for the dialogues and the acting The music is the one other factor that adds onto all that is good in the movie The one sore point is the some what abrupt ending which shows Mark using his own creation to re connect with the very 1st person he hurts in the movie But overall The Social Network leaves a lasting impact with its sharpness and is a very engaging film thanks to the writing department I d give it a 4 5 Even if you re not on Facebook watch it If you are you anyways will,10
7 November 2010,Gentleman of Harvard,I haven t read The Accidental Billionaires and i also not a facebooker mania All i know when i came to the theater is this particularly movie is directed by Mr Fincher and ranked 117 in Top 250 till this date So I expected this film is more than good You know what This film is amazing I think The combination of the script and the plot was executed with brilliant and flawless You can t get confused or bored with that kind of combination i supposed The Cast was perfect for the role even Justin Timberlake is doing a good job for his role i even think the character that he played was who he really is a Jerk Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield was terrific and so the other cast For Me this film is very inspiring and yet to make me think that there are something more precious than money Well that s me maybe you get another thing from this movie which i think it will not a bad thing oyeah and another thing was it was interesting for me and many people from Asia that we get to know a little about life in Harvard well Just a little to know about gentleman of Harvard A must see 9 10,9
27 June 2011,Entertainment. Not biography,This film won a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar and a Golden Globe for best picture Now many would argue that better films were written made in 2010 But let s consider this movie on its own It has budding stars in Eisenberg and Garfield who ll be taking up the mantle of the non traditional hero in the future and The Social Network will be a big reason why Timberlake made me take notice too The music Best Original Score is a big reason why people enjoyed this movie and its not hard to see why Trent Reznor is so popular among those who care Now as the audience the only things that got me interested in the movie before seeing it was Facebook and the masterful David Fincher Like in most of his films he wants us to open our eyes to stuff we wouldn t usually even think of Se7en Fight Club Before watching The Social Network we know we love Facebook and we just want to know more about its creator Mark Zuckerberg And we find out stuff we wouldn t know otherwise about Mark his girlfriend his best friend Eduardo and others his Facebook venture touched We are thoroughly entertained and pass this news to our friends mostly through Facebook But in the end we re compelled to ask ourselves a doubt unlike in Se7en or Fight Club Was Mark really an a hole,7

4 January 2011,The Social Network Reviewed by TheFreeStyleLife.com,THE SOCIAL NETWORK has brought understanding to the terminology social networking Although Mark Zuckerberg deserves the credit of changing how the world communicates the film has also been the best marketing opportunity for Facebook Aaron Sorkin has done a great job of adapting the The Accidental Billionaires along with the casting of Jesse Eisenberg Justin Timberlake applies his musical talents as Sean Parker or the one who changed the music industry with Napster THE SOCIAL NETWORK deserves the nods and accolades that it will receive this award season,8
1 March 2021,Stop comparing it to Zuckerberg's actual life,While it s understandable why a lot of people try to compare this to the real events in Zuckerberg s life I think it s not something we need to understand that it s a movie and not a documentary on his life His life never followed Aristotle s poetics which is considered a Bible for storytelling in the eyes of Aron Sorkin This Zuckerberg comes from the mind of Aron Sorkin And I think it s one of the best scripts I ve ever come across,8
24 September 2010,Entertaining and balanced,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,9
16 October 2011,A Destined Classic,When I had first heard of a project in the works which would cover the founding of Facebook I was both slightly amused and annoyed How could Hollywood allow such a movie to be made that tells such an uninteresting story about one of the biggest social networking sites of this decade However after seeing Fincher director of a number of great movies including Fight Club and Seven being named as it s director and Aaron Sorkin writer of the West Wing is assigned to write a screenplay based off the book The Accidental Billionaires I was somewhat intrigued due to my respect of both of those individuals And even after seeing the spectacular and alluring trailer which featured a beautiful rendition of the Radiohead s song Creep this film was suddenly on my fall must sees After my first viewing I was calling this the film of the year and after more viewings this film has become one of my personal favorites I believe that you can capture a film s mood and essence just in the first scene So I ll start my review there We are thrown into a conversation between two college students Erica Albright and our supposed protagonist Mark Zuckerberg Just by this conversation I am presented with everything that is going to occur later on in the film Acapella groups rowing crew a break up and a condescending asshole genius that is set on joining a Final club just for achieving notoriety Just by this conservation I am introduced to the quick and insightful dialog that will follow throughout he rest of the film along with the breakout performances from both Jesse Eisenberg and even Rooney Mara who steals the only three scenes she s in With this scene I realize that this film is not about Facebook at all but a film about how people in the modern world communicate and how money and greed can lead to betrayal and the spoiling of a friendship or business partnership As I said before there is a break up Erica Albright Rooney Mara once realizing that her boyfriend the computer genius Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg is a jerk dumps him in a hazy bar leaving him mortified So Mark gets revenge in the only way America knows how to do now by trashing her on the Internet After this Mark with help from his fellow programmers decides to create a site that compares girls at Harvard based on their hotness This causes Harvard s server to crash in a night attracting the attention of two future Olympians Tyler and Cameron both played by Armie Hammer and their friend Divya Narendra Max Minghella Hence they present Mark with an idea of a dating site in which girls are able to interact with Harvard guys hoping that he will code it Instead he takes this idea and comes up with a better one a social networking site among college students that closely resembles Final clubs due to their exclusivity After leading Nerendra and the Winklevoss twins on while he launches his site he goes to his best friend Eduardo Saverin for some start up money in exchange for a guaranteed business partnership But the story is told in nonlinear fashion jumping between the Winklevoss law suit AND the law suit from Mark s former best friend Eduardo to Mark s rise to power through the creation of Facebook through a series of flashbacks and flash forwards We are then left to wonder the origins of such law suits through what we are presented As mentioned before the dialog and screenplay is perfect award winning stuff Each scene carries some sort of significance while each line serves some sort of purpose and insight Sorkin really did a great job by tackling a somewhat questionable subject matter and turning it into a profound sense of writing My hat first goes off to him Secondly I have to recognize the brilliance displayed by Fincher here for his use of camera work First and foremost the lighting is a visual treat for me perfectly capturing the cold darkness of a chilly October or the haziness of a college bar in the opening scene Also I have to mention the editing which keeps the interest on screen with numerous shots some even adding a sense of humor to the film which was unexpected for me with the canoe race being a notable scene But Fincher also played a hand in the acting since this film is filled with young stars Eisenberg has shifted from the whole Michael Cera like comic nerd persona evident in Zombieland to a serious dramatic actor Justin Timberlake who portrays Napster founder Sean Parker may be an even bigger surprise with his indulgent but paranoid playboy Andrew Garfield is also strong along with other supporting acts like the amusing Armie Hammer and the scene stealing Rooney Mara which I now see why Fincher cast her for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Also the score by Nine Inch Nails Trent Reznor and AtticusRoss is perfect for this film Dark and eerie and memorable during the opening credits with it s screeching violins and soft piano keys With all these thoughts in mind I think that this film is a destined classic because it functions on all these levels so well After multiple viewings this film has become one of my favorites and will hopefully endure the difficult test of time,10
31 March 2021,Loved it,It was strong film I understood the story everything was good and worth watching,9
28 May 2021,Engrossing 2 hours study of copyright litigations!!,David Fincher is one of my favourite directors after Christopher Nolan and Steven Spielberg and deservedly so because he is very strict in getting the best shot for a particular scene and thus respects the art of film making The Social Network is one hell of a great film by David Fincher which is written by another legendary writer Aaron Sorkin Starring Andrew Garfield and Jessie Eisenberg in lead roles with Justin Timberlake in supporting role it is an engrossing yet informative study on the creation of Facebook by Mark Zuckerberg and the politics behind it regarding the multiple cases of copyright litigations faced by Mark including the one being alleged by his own friend Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfiel Aaron Sorkin s dialogues are very articulate yet interesting to listen too which is accompanied by his fast paced screenplay which actually makes this corporate drama very interesting to watch Also kudos to the editor for such crisp editing The social network is an example of how good of a pair of Fincher and Sorkin is as Fincher has presented this film in such detailed manner and every scene is so well directed that it feels like a very tight and compact film which never loses its focus from the main plot and that is the best thing about his direction Easily my best Fincher movie after Zodiac and Gone Girl,10
7 January 2022,Spectacular,Gives you an all new perspective of not only how harsh business can be but also modern issues The screenplay between the lawsuit scenes and the developing flashbacks is flawless and you re made to feel sympathetic to all the parties involved except Sean despite the cold hard business Zuckerberg did to get where he was and the relationships he ruined along the way,9
23 February 2022,If you don't have any movie in your hand.,The Revolution of a company called Facebook Nice movie but it s getting boring a little bit because there is no action If you think in a business way you can like it but still not enough about context I gave 8 but it s like 7 5 I think I gave a little bit much,8

17 January 2011,"One of the best films, not only of the year, but of the decade.",How could they ever make a film about Facebook The Social Network is one of those films that could ve been bland and pointless But screenwriter Aaron Sorkin s brilliant script is the exact opposite With a lot of dialog and very little detail about the surroundings director David Fincher s priority was to use his imagination for that part And boy did it pay off The Social Network is a beautifully directed brilliantly scripted film The story revolves around young 19 year old Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg and the stemming of his idea to create Facebook a social networking website that is immensely popular now with millions of users The film s killer opening scene really starts off the film nicely with the witty quick dialog that Jesse Eisenberg and Rooney Mara exchange The film really is a gem with the wicked score by Trent Reznor Atticus Cross The bleakness of the music at times really generates a somber scene Greatly acted and beautifully written and directed The Social Network really has no faults But clocking in a 120 minutes the film does a seem a little bit overstretched,10
22 January 2011,A Grossly Overrated But Still Very Good Film,After the watching the ridiculous golden globes and being heartbroken after the phenomenal film Inception lost to this film I sough this film on blu ray and saw for myself apparently the film that was better in inception Firstly lets start with the obvious The Social Network is overrated by everyone I thought this film would be about how facebook is bad and it might be a statement to the current state of our society This is not that film Its ironic that a film about facebook doesn t really delve onto the core issues Be clear about this film its about mark zuckerberg and his associates during the creation of facebook Firstly ill discuss the performances Jesse Eisenberg is very good as Mark Zuckerberg however he is not a revelation he underplays his role and distills a certain amount of disgust as well as a little sympathy for his character Justin Timberlake plays the ultimate sleazeball and does it quite well surprisingly Armie Hammer Brenda Song Rashida Jones and Max Minghella all perform their roles quite well The true revelation among the cast is Andrew Garfield He plays his role brilliantly and is the true emotional catalyst of this film He most definitely deserves an Oscar Next up is the score one that won a golden globe The score is above average at best It is quiet and subtle but occasionally incorporates sounds that are very out of place The screenplay another golden globe winner is often excellent but hindered by boring technical dialogue The dialogue for the most part is natural and engaging however it is not emotionally involving leaving you with a cold feeling The cinematography is good no frames struck me as horrendous or amazing David Fincher has always been a very good director He gets very good performances out of his actors but I felt this film was just extremely cold One scene that was very powerful was the very ending scene which communicated a strong emotional message However after two hours after a heartless film it was a little too late The Social Network as whole is very good drama but certainly not on the level of inception Still it is a good idea to see this film,10
24 May 2012,Even after 20 viewings I'm still not sick of this film yet!! A modern masterpiece most definitely!!,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,10
27 September 2014,A masterpiece,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,
25 October 2010,"An über-master piece of work from Hollywood works almost as a sequel for Fight Club, believe me...",OK just like an ordinary David Fincher fan or an ordinary Facebook user right after I heard he was gonna direct a movie about Facebook my initial response was not any different from anyone else not at all Do we really need a movie about Facebook That website already captivated basis of our social life or even the crumbs of what is left of the website we check mornin noon night Did he really accept that offer when rumours suggesting another film noirs sci fi movies a movie centered on the most popular thing out there I was wrong dead wrong The Social Network is not a Facebook film as many of knew even before we saw it thanks to critics Do you think it s a biopic of Zuckerberg the Gang No David Fincher simply did what he did a decade ago he tells men and their problematic of existence he told what was going wrong at the 90 s an aspect let s say The Social Network is depicting again dead ends of late 2000s and unfortunately the decade we are about the live Nothing is ever never enough Marck Zuckerberg dissed the movie cos the story was further from fact Who cares That dude still feels this movie is about his path of success It as about that generation when they reach the sky they can never fill the hole in their souls Film opens and closes in the same manner Mark having a conversation with the girl he loves but at the end she is not even there the billion worthy invention of his is standing right in the middle He is just a dude keeps hitting that F5 like me That modern world we call so just lies there In between Aaron Sorkin s adaptation is flawless David Fincher took a script with full of dialogs and told the way as fast as it can be which I suppose was not a piece of cake,10
1 July 2020,Have a look!,If you have a somewhat interest in knowing how someone became famous or why his work got so much attention I really recommend you to go and watch this and If you wanna know about how Facebook was developed then stop doing everything and go watch this first I would strongly recommend to people out there who have a keen interest in coding or someone who has interest in computer science because you guys will relate this movie more to your life In my case this was my first biography movie and after watching this and knowing how he used to tackle the problems and what were the difficulties faced by Mark Zuckerberg I aroused a great curiosity in knowing about other big companies like Apple Microsoft etc and I think that same will be the case with you,10
30 March 2021,Absolutely captivating,The character portrait of Mark Zuckerburg is so remarkably inhumane and intelligent that you really wonder what the man cannot do by the end of the movie Absolutely brilliant biography,10
15 October 2010,Good Movie,The Social Network is a good movie and definitely it is good enough to bother going and seeing at the theatre with your friends or even alone it is that good you will have a good time just sitting and watching it The only thing keeping it from being great is that some of the acting is not quite up to par The lead is great and shows Zuckerburg is a real turd of a human being sometimes but also shows that he is a human being with frailties who deserves sympathy as well The movie is good I know because the end of it came and I sat wondering was that really just two hours because it did not feel long at all The only real weak actor was no surprise Justin Timberlake don t mind his music at all but his acting is just not that great maybe he looks a lot like the guy or something but between this and Love Guru I won t be anxious to see him act again that s for sure,8
2 May 2020,RIVIEW OF THE SOCIAL NETWORK,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,3
18 February 2021,the best movie in the entire world,My heart was racing throughout it is SO interesting and well casted,10
11 April 2021,Brilliantly made,This film is still brilliant The script is so well written peppered with the witty retorts you wished would come to you in any argument it s some of Arron Sorkins best work The use of the lawsuits to Frame the extended flashbacks was very well done shifting the subject from What s going to happen into How did this happen allowing us to focus on the heart of the story which is the breakdown of the friendship between Zuckerberg and Saverin And all of it along with the strong performances by all the cast but Eisenburg and Garfield in particular really showcases Sorkin s truly unique style of writing Everything ebbs and flows the rhythm is obvious even to those without much knowledge of screenwriting He frequently uses overlaps to build tension only to puncture it with the many so called Mic drop moments bringing the scenes to satisfying conclusions The characters are pitch perfectly written Zuckerburg is a brilliant protagonist almost but not quite as sympathetic as he is off putting The marrying of Sorkin with David Fincher was in my view a kind of genius You can tell they brought the best out of each other despite their conflicting styles and Fincher does a great job of bringing Sorkins script alive The cinematography is gorgeous in every aspect Many have said this is the film of a generation and while other films have enthused me personally more I cannot fault it It is worth the time,9
5 May 2022,Best biography movie,This is the best biography movie I have watched It tells Zuckerberg s life and how he builds Facebook so well And the cast of the Zuckerberg is solo perfect,10
6 December 2010,There Must be a Cure,If I had to imagine the person who created Facebook I would imagine the Mark Zuckerberg of the movie The Social Network Indeed I would imagine an uncomfortable social misfit eager for some kind of power and especially the power to hurt people he can t own A player whose favorite pastime with the girlfriend is one upping the girlfriend routing her in every conversation A frustrated social climber ready and eager to play and exploit those with money and social standing A user bright enough to create Facebook and schizophrenic enough to justify every security gaffe that leaves users exposed and vulnerable for exactly as long as it takes for Whomever to get whatever information it wants from Facebook I would imagine a creepy power hungry freak who didn t care about whom he exposed or exploited on the way to wherever he wanted to go Watching The Social Network on Sunday night I did not imagine I was watching the biography of Mark Zuckerberg I did not think for a moment there was a one to one correspondence between what was happening on the screen and what happened in the life of the Harvard students who created Facebook But I did see a creative exploration of the question What kind of person created Facebook and what kind of person thinks it s a good use of time Because I think Facebook is the antithesis of me I was completely comfortable with the idea that Facebook s founder is an emotionally damaged social misfit which is to say a greedy selfish little bastard who doesn t care about whom he hurts or how badly Nevertheless I was glad the movie was over when it was because all that bad karma on a Sunday night is not a good thing The Social Network has Facebook growing out of a young man s desire to hurt a young woman who sensibly spurned him Can good come of that I don t think so The movie also shows some avid Facebookers becoming obsessive and paranoid thanks to their living too closely to the pages they stalk A good thing When there s so much air to breathe out there in the real world can it be The Social Network is a good movie that ended exactly when it should have My prediction When the sixth edition of the DSM comes out Facebook will be a diagnosis May the Pill People offer up a cure for it,8
16 October 2010,Facebook?,You ve all heard about it but now its here The Social Network the movie about a simple site that started a revolution is already wowing audiences across the globe David Fincher Fight Club The Curious Case of Benjamin Button directs this Facebook tale with a style all his own His innovative cinematography captures a beautiful look and feel unique to this film The young cast full of unknowns rising stars delivers in their best work to date Jesse Eisenberg plays a cold calculated genius yet still provokes the audiences sympathies His counterpart Andrew Garfield portrays a much more inviting character which only adds to the impact to the betrayal between the two Despite this film s many achievements the main phenomenon is the writer Aaron Sorkin From the interesting time line to the rapid fire dialogue Sorkin shows his true genius The writing is a true highlight of the film and will be remembered around Oscar season After all is said and done what remains the most surprising about this Facebook film is that it is barely about Facebook It s about greed friendship and the power of ambition This modern take on these classic themes adds to the monumental success of the film All in all The Social Network is arguably the best film this year,10
21 January 2011,Truly Deserves All The Recognition It's Receiving,I just finished this film about 10 minutes ago and felt myself immediately motivated to check my Facebook I ve been a fan of David s films since first seeing Fight Club and I personally view this as one of his top 3 films if not number 1 or 2 After noticing the recognition it s been receiving at such award ceremonies such as the Critic s Choice and the Golden Globes I first thought it was over estimated after seeing blockbusters like Inception I did feel the urge to check it out though It is a fantastic film without all of the big budget explosions and special effects This is truly great story telling and David can make the most dull scenes feeling extremely exciting After watching this film in it s entirety I now understand why it has received so many awards I normally shy away from writing reviews but this movie has inspired me to do so This is most certainly the must see film of 2010 or any other year for that matter,8
22 October 2015,The Social Network isn't a story based movie with assertive plot like Se7en,Actually I have been a member of facebook since 2009 When I heard for the first time that one of my favorite directors David Fincher is going to make a movie based on facebook s story I was wondering what kind of interesting point Fincher sees in this It could be a boring movie without any sign of excitement we used to see in his previous movies By the way he proved that I was wrong This is on of his best movies and I m glad that Fincher successfully turned this typical story into some valuable narratives The Social Network isn t a story based movie with assertive plot like Se7en but I can say it s a plot based movie There are some young people coming up with an idea making a website which gathers people together in a limited range of places Harvard university in the first place As Mark Zukerberg says in the movie You don t get 500 million friends without making a few enemies Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg founder of the website finds himself disputing with some people including his best friend Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield The movie goes forward very well The main story happens in a court in which the history of founding of the website is told in flashbacks All the scenes present and past are related perfectly that face you with a pleasant story until its very end You may don t like villains of the movie Winklevoss brothers because of course they are not the second version of a eloquent serial killer like John Doe but I m sure they are in the best place they could ever be however it depends on your standpoint whether like them or not because they are just some inept geek university students Fincher with The Social Network proves that you don t necessarily need to have a criminal story to keep the viewers up to the screen and he also proves that even most commonplace events can be complicated deep inside,8
3 November 2010,Definitely THE BEST FILM OF THE YEAR (FOR ME),upon on hearing about this film i was very interested as i go on facebook a lot The cast were perfect especially Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg when going to see the film i couldn t make my mind up of what genre it was then i realised after the first 10 minutes it was a drama with elements of comedy the story of mark zuckerberg was extremely entertaining and i left the cinema with my friends so interested and intrigued about this sites creator who i know nothing about and recommend this film to any It will be more appreciated by those who go on facebook but let s face it who isn t 9 10 for me hope you enjoy it,9
9 October 2010,GREAT screenplay and acting,I really liked this movie engaging from beginning to end All the acting and the dialogue is superb Jessie Eisenberg should be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar as well as Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin for Best Supporting Actor While it clearly is a work of fiction and must be accepted as such it parallels the history of Facebook which is a fascinating story I believe Mark Zuckerberg may have poor social skills but I don t know if he is really as far on the Autistic continuum as this movie portrays Also having had a son at Harvard during this exact time period I think the pompous aristocratic clubs and parties were highly exaggerated And yes Larry Summers can be an ass but his scene was a little over the top I think it made the Woosledick twins look like jerks which they were,10
22 October 2010,"I ""liked"" this.",Once again Aaron Sorkin captivates his audience with his uncanny ability to create fascinating characters for the big screen Regardless of your familiarity with Facebook or the Internet in general you ll find yourself relating to these imperfect very human individuals portrayed in The Social Network While based on a true story Sorkin doesn t shy away from taking liberty to extend his own interpretation of the main character Mark Zuckerburg in this classic tale of friendship and betrayal My only disappointment in this film was the fact that I had super high expectations of seeing a Fincher esquire film Don t get me wrong the film was shot beautifully it just didn t have the David Fincher quality we all know from such classics as Fight Club and Panic Room,9
23 October 2011,Amazing film,Amazing film Face book has become such an amazing tool for society I mean they are even measuring peoples intelligence based on it in connection to their friends hahaha Im serious check it out http www trustedworldnews com facebookfriendslinkedtobrainsize html I really suggest watching this film I think the viewer will definitely take a lot out of it I mean the guy is such a genius how he created this network the amount of work that was involved You always need good people behind you and I think this movie shows that with a lot of hard work and determination people can achieve their dreams I give this movie 9 10,
14 January 2011,Jerks at Ivy League School Play Games With Each Other,David Fincher has been a great director This time he poses a question How do you make a good movie about Ivy League jerks Answer You don t This is a well made movie about small potato people who are very impressed with themselves The actors look good the cinematographer knows how to frame a shot and use high grade filters and the result is better than a sleeping pill if you have insomnia The one high point for me is that Andrew Garfield s presence in the movie might bring attention to Boy A and The Red Riding Trilogy both far more interesting than this dud,5
15 May 2011,Prepare to be inspired,When I first heard about this film I anticipated it to be another take on the traditional and over used story of one mans transformation from rags to riches a storyline which has slowly lost any originality However review after review were describing this as a masterpiece in film making this for obvious reasons grabbed the presses and my own attention and it quickly became the must see film for them myself and everyone else with a brain After months of waiting and waiting I was finally presented with the chance to see this much hyped over film the film which seemed to alter the traditional story of one mans new found wealth a film which alters our view on just how hard it is to get somewhere in life a film about something so large it has changed the lives of many describing in great detail and precision how Facebook became the worlds largest social network And it did not disappoint Every second of this film was riveting and showed in great detail the difficult birth of Facebook in an inspiring and thought provoking fashion Teamed with the performances of such actors as Justin Timberlake Andrew Garfield and the Main star Jesse Eisenberg they each perform to a standard Higher than almost any film I have seen before or since In short if you really love films then watch this,9
14 October 2015,David Fincher the master,When i heard that Fincher directed the movie about Facebook i was disappointed I just couldn t imagine that Fincher would be interested in a story like that one so i watch the movie after few years and yes he did it again he pulled the strings where they need to be pulled like puppet master Also Sorkins writing is great and actors are really good I don t like this virtual world much and my man Fincher shows all the downfalls of living in one Great movie about the soul less world There was no much room for camera and other effects to be a big part of this movie and Fincher know that and instead he concentrates on a story and yes he did great job again Good decision to watch this movie after so long because im not disappointed,9
3 October 2010,As good as it's hyped!,As the summary says The Social Network is just as good as it is hyped up to be The acting is brilliant as well as the screenplay and David Fincher s usual genius as a director Now for starters Jessie Eisenberg Eisenberg gives his best performance since The Squid and the Whale and it could quite possibly pass that to be his best performance ever though at the beginning of the movie I found his character difficult to like because of how socially awkward he was but the character of Zuckerberg grew on me as the movie went on This movie has been receiving quite a bit of Oscar buzz lately and one of the categories it has been receiving much of is best supporting actor for Justin Timberlake and rightfully so He was simply wonderful for me his performance really put the movie over the top from a pretty good movie to a great movie Of course though the movie is not perfect by any means despite the fact that it is about the youngest self made billionaire and how it s about facebook the story is your typical rise and fall film It s not all that original Oscar Buzz This movie will certainly be nominated for a few Oscars Here s the list of what I think it will be nominated for Best Actor Jesse Eisenberg Best Supporting Actor Justin Timberlake Best Director David Fincher Best Adapted Screenplay Aaron Sorkin Best Film Editing Best Sound Editing Best Sound Mixing Best Cinematography Best Picture Total 9 nominations Of these 9 nominations I believe it will win two I believe Aaron Sorkin will win for best adapted screenplay and Justin Timberlake will win for Best Supporting Actor As for all the best director picture actor buzz I think we all have forgotten about this little movie called Inception which is my pick to take home all the big awards this year considering it s fantastic reviews and dominating box office performance as well as the fact that the whole reason there are ten nominations for best picture is because The Dark Knight wasn t nominated for best picture and Nolan wasn t nominated for director The academy does have the tendency to hand out sorry we didn t give you this last time awards which will probably happen with Inception because of how robbed Nolan was at the 2009 awards,10
10 December 2013,Fincher proves why Facebook is and will always be without par.,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,10
30 November 2018,Not what I expected,This movie was not what I was expected granted though I had never read the synopsis I expected a group of friends creating Facebook and having fun That was about 5 minutes of the movie It was a lot darker and sadder than I expected Most of the characters made me mad I seriously only loved Dakota Johnson s character I hate Justin Timberlake even more now Last thing to add I love love love Andrew Garfield but WHY is he playing a Brazilian named Eduardo,7
8 July 2015,This is only the beginning.,Social media It dominates our everyday lives We can barely remember a time when we weren t glued to our phones or even when phone wasn t a ubiquitous term for cell phone or when cell phone wasn t an antiquated term for iPhone or Smartphone Sites like Twitter YouTube and foursquare or Swarm comprise the majority of our everyday online experiences It was Facebook that took it to a level no one could have possibly predicted With the creation of Facebook everyone had a chance to view each other s lives in a way that was not previously conceptualized Or was That s what this film is about The lawsuits that arose after Facebook s founding was called into legal question makes for thrice Oscar nominated cinema that is paralleled by no other Now connecting upwards of 1 7th of humanity Facebook has given rise to people and organizations previously unthinkable in that Harvard dorm room straight out of A Beautiful Mind But this is only the beginning As President and Head Administrator of the Facebook group Future Presidents of the United States and having been contacted by the White House thanks to my efforts I can safely say that Mr Zuckerberg Mr Severin and countless other individuals responsible for the creation and upkeep of Facebook have not yet fully realized the scope and scale of what they have unleashed upon the world The intersection of history and technology has been demonstrated to change the course of humanity throughout various eras I think it s safe to say that this is the beginning of one of those eras Though Facebook turned 11 this past February it s only in its infancy Where will it be at 20 30 50 100 The Internet and Cyberspace in general won t be going anywhere anytime soon Democracy and politics in general won t be going anywhere anytime soon How will Facebook and the Internet in general change the landscape to make way for the most technologically literate generation the world has ever seen Generation Y to not only take the reigns of power but to keep the reigns of power It appears to me that in my many platforms of research that Millennials are somewhat of a novelty We seem to be stuck in a kind of Purgatory neither advancing on the world stage nor shrinking away from it There is no one central figure among us who we can point to and say That s who we are That person represents us That person will more than likely come from Facebook Not necessarily the founders not necessarily its current architects but one of us One of its members And no not necessarily me either I m not looking to gain publicity for the sake of gaining publicity I m just looking to set myself apart from the crowd and call attention to a number of issues facing not only my generation but the generations that will depend on us to receive the passing of the torch The coherency of the message is lost in the roar of the crowd People have to be willing to make themselves vulnerable and stand up for what is right Alone And in this hyper connected day and age that s not something many people are willing or even able to do But I am I am one of many I am not alone I have made it my professional intention to look ahead and ponder the long term future of not only Facebook but the Internet in general This second dimension of humanity isn t going anywhere anytime soon Neither is Facebook It is essential in the everyday lives of billions It all started in a Harvard dorm room Look for sequels to this movie There are a lot more to come,9
26 October 2017,"9 out of 10 people will ""Like"" this movie",The Social Network Review In American cinema the get rich or die trying mantra is exemplified in several figures from the rugged frontiersman out in the old west The Good the Bad and the Ugly and the Revenant the business tycoon Citizen Kane and Wolf of Wall Street and the various American gangsters fulfilling their ethnic stereotypes Godfather Scarface and the Departed These figures in these movies have many positive qualities like bravery craftiness and determination however they also have many vices greed and thirst for power is the most notable In David Fincher s the Social Network our protagonist is no different Mark Zuckerburg played by Jesse Eisenberg personifies a new generation of anti hero the jaded and insecure computer nerd Mark feels he needs to distinguish himself from others while at the hyper competitive Harvard Mark s motivation to be better however turns into an obsession This obsession to be the best jeopardizes his relationship with everyone who is close to him like his girlfriend and best friend The Social Network succeeds like a good gangster flick by showing how Mark s time at Harvard and his determination to succeed turned him into a monster or as the film would call an asshole An interesting question driving the film is Mark an individual asshole or a byproduct of a narcissistic society By answering the question about Mark it should also make you take a moment to pause and question yourself and wonder if you have ever been an asshole What makes this protagonist so well done is that Mark s online experiences are relatable for many young people watching the film In a new era where everything is online from how beautiful people think you are to messages about your ex that you wish you could take back The Social Network covers a lot of ground about these brand new social dynamics that are still in 2017 are little discussed and it seems like little resistance to social media is given In 2010 Facebook was the premier social network but now the number of apps is only growing from twitter snapchat Instagram tinder and myspace to a name a few okay I am making a joke about the last one no one still uses myspace But these new social networking sites have influenced the way humans interact and how we view each other in our societal hierarchy The networks have changed society with little resistance and little discussion and the Social Network does an excellent job in trying to tackle this issue You will have to watch the movie to see if Mark is ever free from being wired in but it will defiantly make you reconsider both the utility of social networking sites like Facebook and the need to be the best In sum excellent acting and a thoughtful and original script make it worth at least one watch The only con is that the secondary characters have little arc as the protagonist Mark takes center stage Therefore the film could have been stronger if the other characters like Eduardo and Sean weren t so flat and linear,9
10 January 2022,Wow just wow,I started watching this movie for Andrew Garfield but but but man I was totally impressed I really liked the way everyone acted and so many things to learn as a cse student,10
7 June 2020,Wish I Watched It Sooner!,I can not believe I put off watching this film for a whole decade granted I was ten at the time of its release haha Although I had to immediately search up if all of the information portrayed was accurate moments after the credits began rolling sorry to say but the truth is overdramatized according to various sources it was an incredibly well done film Though 2 hours in length The Social Network had me wishing it was even longer There was not a single moment I was not enticed by what was occurring in the story from the absolute second it starts you are immersed into the incredibly baffling mind of Mark Zuckerberg and all those who contributed to the creation of Facebook If you are looking for a somewhat educational film that emphasizes on the drama and crime then I highly recommend The Social Network,8
19 January 2011,Don't waste time,The film that you should watch if you have nothing else to do No story no cinematography That is it One of millions of mediocre films that should deserve no attention at all But as the name of website that wastes peoples times force them into false relationships andcheating stands behinds it then understandable to why it draws GoldenGlobe s and others attention Don t be surprised if it gets Academy Award too It is really a shame for Dave to come up with something like this certainly not to be compared with some of his masterpiece films I wonder when directors will stop thinking about money and fame at least after getting enough of them and try to create their own style and think about the people,4
26 January 2022,I really love this movie!!!,This is one of the movies that I watch when I want to remind myself why am I studying in school to learn how to code And I really liked the legal part of this movie too it was really entertaining,9
9 April 2021,Good,I watch this movie like once a month I love david finchaaaaa,9
7 February 2022,Oh no guys my shares got diluted (Business Studies Vibes),Yeah this is really good takes two mates falling out and one reducing the other one s shares into something Shakespearean The direction is really stylised and very engaging Also the guy looks nothing like Zucc just got somewhat similar hair,10
19 March 2013,What a waste of a movie,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,5
5 October 2010,"There is a ""Like"" button for this movie and I will not be surprised if you ""Favorite"" this movie.",There is a Like button for this movie and I will not be surprised if you Favorite this movie Fascinating storytelling beautiful cinematography and brilliant performance by Jesse Eisenberg Aaron Sorkin s screenplay and David Fincher s direction have made this movie incredibly engaging the moment the movie starts it simply takes your breath away Jesse perfectly portrayed a computer genius who s as complicated as those programming source codes and every gesture he made defines a computer geek I have a feeling that he s going to receive an Oscar nomination for his performance in this movie He really deserves it As for the writer Aaron Sorkin will easily win an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay Friendship ambition desire envy betrayal and revenge you will find yourself so wrong if you think The Social Network is going to be a typical documentary biography style movie And there s no words I can describe how much I love David Fincher as a director perhaps it s time to give him an Oscar Let s wait and see how The Social Network will dominate this year s award season,10
8 October 2010,"Electric, Entertaining, and never hit a wrong note",David Fincher is one of my favorite directors I had high expectations going into this movie and my expectations were met This movie is not like most other David Fincher movies It doesn t have any twists to it like fight club or seven Its a straight forward incredible true story Even though this movie isn t all true it is still a great story The acting in this movie is very good and i was very impressed with Jesse Eisenberg But the most impressive acting part in this movie is Justin Timberlake I never really liked him unless he was on SNL but he really delivers here and does a great job of making people have mixed emotions about his part Some people will like him and some people will think hes a total douche bag I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes great screenplays and great acting,10
21 December 2017,WOMEN,I remember sitting in a well lit spacious classroom talking to my friend who has long voluminous beautiful hair and she was telling about seeing this movie in Dubai and saying that it filled her with passion for coding that Mark co are so smart that she wishes we were like them We were IT majors It must have been in 2010 or 2011 as she graduated in 2012 and I did in 2013 Those years I hardly watched any movies as I was too obsessed with TV shows I watched hundreds of them mastering English and failing my classes in the meantime Now in December of 2017 I am getting slowly back to my roots watching movies and reading articles albeit very slowly and sporadically It s weird if I had watched this movie earlier I d probably have given it 10 stars because it was gripping exciting and aesthetically pleasing But I am too deep in the tumblr and twitter culture now that I couldn t ignore how glaring the lack of good representation of women was in this film They were either crazy unimportant or a prize that was awarded for anyone who got ahead,5
19 October 2011,Great Depiction of a person with Asperger's Syndrome,I really enjoyed this movie I do not think of a better casting than Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg I feel Eisenburg s performance was far more entailed that Colin Firth s not to take anything away from Firth and should have won the Oscar for Male Lead Preformer As a Computer major in the late 70 s it was enjoyable to see so many personalities that computer programmers possess haven t changed If you read The Accidental Billionaires you will find this movie not only stands up to the book but Eisenberg s portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg to be an incredible interpretation that you almost get lost thinking that Eisenberg is actually Mark Zuckerberg On another note that is close to my hear is in both the book and movie it is obvious that Zuckerberg shows most of the classic traits of a person with Asperger s Syndrome This is a personal observation and in no way indicated that Zuckerberg has been diagnosed with Asperger s Many computer programmers deal with Asperger s Sysdrome Bill Gates being one of the most famous people with Asperger s I think this movie has something for people of all sorts of walks in life from computer geeks programmers Facebook users students health professionals and people curious on how am incredible website like Facebook would come to life I for one knew people in school who shared many of the personalities of the characters in this film and smiled many times as an individual personality would match up with someone I know This is one of the better movies I have watched in a long time,
9 October 2010,a true work of filmmaking genius,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,
11 November 2010,Flawless Masterpiece?,When I first hear about this film my initial thought was Yes this is going to make a lot of money chances are its going to be a tacky Hollywood film The Social Network came out in the States before it came out in New Zealand so that gave me abit of time to read other reviews I was shocked to read some people saying things like This film is a flawless masterpiece or This is easily the best film in the last ten years After thinking and talking about The Social Network after getting home from the cinema last night I would say that for the most part this film lives up to its reviews Its almost like i was on the edge of my seat the whole time The dialog is fast It seems that computer geeks talk quickly a joke of course The acting is believable and the script has been beautifully written Justin Timberlake who plays Sean Parker Creator of Napster really impressed me I think he did a brilliant job and in my opinion is a great actor maybe not quite as much as he is a musician but it still did a great job I recommend this film to anyone who wants a intense 2 hours of film 9 10,9
20 September 2011,Film Review on Relation to Theme,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,
23 December 2010,Thank You to David Fincher,When I initially heard that a movie was going to be made of Facebook i became instantly sceptical that it was too soon and that a studio was trying desperately to bank off of the social networking phenom during times of tough box office sales When I later found out that Fincher was pushing the vehicle of this massive potential for a motion picture I took a sigh of relief and began looking forward to the release date Having seen the movie twice now I am certain that Fincher did us all a great big favor by providing us with a great analysis of the history behind the man and the movement of Facebook Mr Eisenberg is cut to perfection in this film and with the great direction of Aaron Sorkin s fast paced and edgy script the formula is set for a perfect dynamic The quick paced dialogue allows us a perception into Zuckerberg brain an overwhelming high adrenaline hard to keep up with mind THe edginess to his character compounded with the back and forth motion of the past and present scene sequence is great in showing how quickly things moved and how fast everything was going for these kids It s really a great film to see whether or not one is a fan of facebook For those who have seen pirates of silicon valley a story of the developments of Mac and PC and the rivaling feud of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates when computers were slowly rising as personal desktops the social network is somewhat reminiscent of that film in the way that young bright college minds push on an idea are completely smitten with the business and corporate world and become instant rock stars of their time It s great seeing the roots being planted of an idea that is capable of changing the whole online and social networking world Fan or not of facebook i highly recommend watching this Fincher flick,9
15 June 2011,Really interesting history,Even if I am a facebook user I have not read yet any history about its foundation The movie was really interesting and explained easily the born and the growth of this social network It was interesting as well to find Justin Timberlake as actor of this movie The storytelling was easy and interesting to follow When we took the movie from the store we thought it could one of those boring movies telling you the story as a documentary But maybe due to the particular history of facebook this movie shows us the opposite Every minute was interesting to watch Every minute give you the possibility to learn how this big social media growth up where the ideas came from and overall the difficulties related to its development It is quite funny the end of the movie An action which I am used to see in many facebook users,8
23 August 2011,You don't get 500 million friends without making a few enemies,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,

4 April 2013,"you are not an asshole, you're just trying so hard to be.",In the end of the story Mark ends up loosing the lawsuit The girl who had admired him before said to him after refusing his invitation for dinner that you are not an asshole you are just trying so hard to be It seems quite contradictory but it is actually true when people facing a material world and all those moral judgments We can even say that it reflects the nature of humanity since under the storm of fast moving lives is the loneliness of the individuals and the tragedy of the whole society Why the distance between people gets increasing when the world actually gets smaller Why do people feel tired all the time and find that life is just filled with the things that they are not willing to do at all Mark Edward Shawn or Brother Winklevoss There are no good guys or bad guys in the film because we are all doing what we are supposed to do in this sick world The end of the film has already told us that there is no winner of any kinds we are all the losers but just loosing different things,10
9 July 2023,The best film of the last 20 maybe 30 years,Honestly this film doesn t get enough credit that it goets it s a masterpiece from start to finish the editing the mixing the music the directing the acting Brilliant film flawless and never a dull moment From the magical opening scene to the incredile deposition film shots the sharp and very very witty dialogue between all actors the dynamism between the twins the drecting irony of using a musical sensation of Justin Timberlake to play Sean Parker a guy who nearly wrecked the music industry It s a shame that this audience didn t receive this film as much as the critics did Utterly incredible,10
26 January 2021,smooth and deep,There are no conclusions there is no court there is no judgement but stories from the point of view of each character very elaborate characters told very smooth At the same time very easy and very deep story,
23 March 2014,David Fincher. What else?,David Fincher s work is truly remarkable But the script is even better incredibly written by Aaron Sorkin It s just smart funny and real There was not even one useless dialogue Everything they said was important and interesting You feel you ve known those characters for ages And you re always wishing you could have been part of that project Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield were amazing Their flawless performances were one of the most important things that made this an exceptional film Now David Fincher What can I say He never fails Never After Se7en Fight Club and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button this is his well deserved ticket into hall of fame greatness All in all The Social Network is a beautiful masterpiece with an excellent soundtrack that will allow you to know and get familiar with this amazing story the creation of Facebook,10
7 January 2016,An Average Movie,The movie is a story of Facebook founder Mark and how the Facebook has become possible after the the Facebook After watching the movie the image of Mark Zuckerberg is tarnished according to the story in the movie though later Mark Zuckerberg expressed his disagreement with the story Andrew Garfield again proved his skills Jesse too played his role nicely but it was Andrew who stole the limelight The movie revolves around the court and the college and facebook life for the Mark All the actors were great with their roles In the movie the character Mark Zuckerberg inspired me by his hard work and dedication his creativity and decision making skills and ideas But the movie has shown the other side of him as unfriendly deceitful and rude his unaccepted behaviour towards his girlfriend when she broke up with him The movie has shown us the truth of life in Silicon valley But it was just an average movie and not good for Zuckerberg s fan P,6
4 October 2010,The Social Network is an Instant Classic,I can t remember the last time I attended a film that had me simultaneously entertained and engaged After the movie TSN instantly became a hot topic for discussion at my house The people I went with to see the movie were all across the board age group wise and everyone walked away with a different perspective and opinion Sounds silly but I hope they make a sequel 10 years from now as we continue to experience the effects of Facebook and become privy to the power play and players involved Bravo to Triggerstreet Columbia Sony for a top rate picture I ve been back twice now to see the movie something I haven t done in years Be great to see some more work spring forth from this great combo of Writers Director Producers,

7 July 2017,One of the best films of 2010 for sure.,I skipped out on the social network when it first released back in 2010 I was fourteen at the time and watching the promos and trailers for it really only made me think A movie about Facebook I ll pass thanks but having watched the movie for a second time now after noticing a lot of praise for it and coming to be a little more accepting to genres and actors I hadn t been very into before and seeing Andrew Garfield s performance in Hacksaw Ridge I can honestly say this movie is probably one of my favorite of the decade so far In all honesty it s not a movie about Will Facebook become successful despite the lawsuit since we all know that it does It s a movie about the deterioration of friendships and how the idea of success can come to change someone It s beautifully acted and Aaron Sorkin s dialogue is some of the best I ve ever seen It s never boring even at it s slowest and it s definitely worth a watch,9
11 December 2018,"Beautifully scored, beautifully shot, amazing acting, awesome score",This movie is just the epitome of all things great Each scene flows seamlessly into the next the line delivery is superb and the soundtrack matches each scene perfectly And the shots in this movie The camerawork is great A must see,10
15 April 2022,An excellent biopic,The original score is incredible it gives such a good rhythm to the movie it is very much entertaining and very well put together You never get bored watching it and the actors performances are top notch,10

29 January 2019,great lessons from this movie,I have watch the social networks film and i enjoy it with my friends I learn some lessons from this movie one is about how can you move bigger with your project when you partner with other people who have resources that your project need And vice versa when you prefer to do everything on your own and wait until you have the resources to expand your project while other may still your Idea and build a project bigger than yours And then they precede you,8
17 February 2021,Motivational,If you want to get motivated for college go ahead and watch The Social Network directed by David Fincher it s on Netflix at the moment The script written by Aaron Sorkin is witty sharp and has an almost musical quality that makes you want to tour encyclopedias cover to cover while listening to drumbeat patterns You can t help but hang on to every meticulously uttered word The dialogue is spoken with confidence unmoving and absolute it makes real life seem dull in comparison The soundtrack by Nine Inch Nails provides a haunting atmosphere that sounds like a combination of beeping computer hardware the twinkling melody of innovation and the crushing roar of loneliness under the guise of the ultimate popularity The tone of the movie would be different if there were mellow upbeat guitar twangs and drum crashes rather than this melancholy masterpiece The immediately recognizable triplet of piano notes that occasionally weaves in and out of the score is haunting The lack of stereotypical shots of glory where the music crescendos and the orchestra goes fortissimo makes for droning electronically harsh sounds to fill up the background in such an omnipresent and subtle way that you don t even register when the music picks up the marriage of sound to scene is so darn tight It s surprising when you go listen to the soundtrack itself and hear the screeching blasts of audio that could only come from machine Was that in the movie Yes it was quite loud too The lighting set design and cinematography are just magnificent The warm ambient lighting of Harvard dorms and legal deposition rooms shroud the scenes with such a cozy intimacy that I myself watch this film when I m sick and want to feel comfortable The iconic campus of Harvard is majestic you could very well believe that the cement holding the reddish brown brick together contains the very foundations of knowledge itself Prestigious Harvard banners litter dorm room backgrounds as drinking undergrads party the night away reminding you that even students at the highest level of academia know how get loose as they gyrate half naked on an ottoman to the hottest new pop track Sick The modern designs of furniture later in the film are not only a signal to the passing of time they re the embodiment of current era tech they re sleek gunmetal grey ergonomic and downright sexy Fincher s shots are gorgeous as hell his preference for static camerawork means there are innumerable moments where you could pause the film and BOOM put it on a poster and nobody would question its validity The acting performances are without flaw I can t imagine any other actor in the place of Jesse Eisenberg Justin Timberlake plays the role of a cunning and crafty entrepreneur a little too well and Andrew Garfield is so much more than a webslinger in spandex All these components of the film come together to form an immensely satisfying piece of art a masterclass in filmmaking that keeps me coming back for more Maybe feeling ill isn t so bad As for the substance well there s a lot This film has a lot of themes it depicts the rustle and tussle underneath the glittering waters of wildly successful enterprise and within that picture you get lessons on relatinships class betrayal ambition greed jealousy breakthrough fulfilment comradery and a smorgasbord of other messages worth thinking about There are so many different ways in which you can view this film and each angle is as riveting and as lucid as the rest The Social Network is very much a modern film yet it has themes that stretch back to the innovative Shakespearian literature Looking past the more grandiose messages you get my favorite element from the story The Social Network is about living among an incredibly intelligent high achieving population and attempting the tough task of separating yourself from the rest of the lot Mark Zuckerberg is FOCUSED on his pursuit of distinction This film makes you want to go to college and not just get solid GPAs and internships it makes you want to offer something far larger than that something groundbreaking something that changes the game It makes you want to SPEND your youth instead of merely LIVING it It makes you want to THRIVE instead of SURVIVING in college The theme of how some wildly ambitious kids tromping near the eve of their primes managed to build a social network that promptly took over the entire world and permeated the thick barriers of billions of skulls seeping into the know is nothing short of inspirational In the industry there exists tons of feel good films that seek to motivate you but those motivational messages are lost when translated to reality there s too much sunshine too much rainbow and then they have the audacity to tell us that there s even a pot of gold at the end The Social Network is serious it s not afraid of imperfection of blemish of the ugly no it assertively informs us of it The invigorating message of The Social Network isn t something the film actively advertises it sits prettily at the core there for us to derive It s an alternative take to the Scarface esque neon red inscription on a golden globe statue the world is yours Only instead of guns cocaine on the tip of your nose and Michelle Pfeiffer in a sleek dress it s computers coffee under your breath and Rooney Mara on an LCD laptop screen System out println The world truly is yours I m recommending what s probably the most significant film of the past decade Its social commentary historical significance and motivational inclinations are all packaged up in an aesthetically pleasing format that we will look back at in awe later in the future I guarantee it It deserved every accolade it got and more lost respect for The Oscars after finding out The King s Speech won best picture over this Do yourself a favor and go watch The Social Network Fincher you damn genius let me throw my money at you respectfully,10
14 February 2020,Great movie !!,This movie really gave us in inside on how the creation of Facebook happened and how there was challenges through the years of Mark Zuckerberg This movie also gives us a side of Mark Zuckerberg that not most people know,9
21 August 2019,Another movie drowning in audio,What a shame that this well done screenplay is a struggle to hear The background music is overwhelming in many scenes,5
23 December 2010,Problem with dialog,I hadn t been too interested in seeing this but after all the press and positive comments I realized I had to give it a go Glad I did My wife and I enjoyed this film very much and since we are both Facebook members it was interesting as well However we had a lot of trouble understanding the dialog during many of the scenes where the characters were in a noisy location i e bar dance club etc Having been big fans of The West Wing over the years we were expecting some great dialog from Sorkin but I m afraid we missed quite a lot of it due to the strong background music playing through many scenes I m wondering if others experienced the same thing either in the theater or on a DVD screener or was it just my TV sound settings Guess we ll have to watch it again with sub titles,9
27 January 2020,A great movie about becoming a friend,The movie does a great job at making people strongly dislike Mark showing different situations where he is in a grey to dark grey area of right and wrong We see his arc fluctuate between being in the wrong to being wronged Its a great movie that teaches the masses about supply and demand a wonderful example for economics classes to use as a point of teaching,8
28 January 2020,"Exceptional Film, Only One Flaw",Overall the movie was very well directed and sophisticated In fact the only flaw I found with this movie is that it may have been a bit too sophisticated at times As someone who is not as technologically savvy as Mark Zuckerberg I often found it hard to understand what he was talking about Although I am aware that the reason Jesse Eisenberg s lines as Mark Zuckerberg were so advanced in vocabulary was to portray Mark as accurately as possible it made it hard for viewers such as myself to fully grasp what was going on Other than that this film was astounding It really helped me get to know Mark as more than just the founder of Facebook When I first learned that we would be watching this film in class I had very low hopes to be quite honest as I had never even heard about this movie before I am glad that I was wrong and I actually ended up liking this movie very much It was about more than just the creation of Facebook It was about friendship and betrayal as well as supply and demand In this case Facebook allowing its users to connect and interact with one another is the supply whereas its users desire to connect with others is the demand As demand went up so did the supply which is what would lead to Mark becoming the youngest billionaire at that time Overall it was an exceptional film and well worth the watch,9
28 January 2020,Absolutely Stunning!,This movie on first viewing was a spectacle to my brain It doesn t use flashy special effects or action but instead uses flashy dialogue and editing to really keep the viewer watching The snappy clever dialogue thats written makes every line rememberable and it really stuck to me days after watching it The acting was amazing especially from Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin and even Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker These actors convey such emotion through their characters they seem like they were born for the roll The scene I always come back to without spoilers is emotional climax The acting pacing dialogue all comes together so perfectly that the scene resonates so well afterward Rewatches are even more entertaining because you can pick out new info and touches you never saw during the times before Its the only movie I rewatched twice after I saw it for the first time Brilliant,10
24 April 2020,Surprisingly good,A seemingly boring fact computernerd designs popular website becomes in the hands of a master director a dazzling and energetic drama with fantastic renditions of the entire cast This seemingly physical role also made me aware of Jesse Eisenberg for the first time and every time I see him in a later or earlier made film I still have to think about this role for a moment Compliments also for Justin Timberlake as the slick Sean Parker but as said all the actors are great The complex narrative structure doesn t stand in the way of the clarity of the plot at all and keeps the film captivating at all times cleverly exposing all points of view Those who ignore The social network because they don t have Facebook after all miss out on something if only because the film is not only about Facebook but also about friendship social status the problems surrounding intellectual property and the temptations of corporate business,8
9 May 2020,Rule of cool,The movie is actually pretty cool the Mark Zukerberg that is played by Jesse Eisenberg has a lot of charm and that they have been portrayed him as an asocial geek but with a shred of humanity was a great idea his interactions and conflicts with others helps to create his character and the side characters are also good although the Winklevoss twins could have been better since they hardly have any background or interaction with any situation beyond being the antagonists of the film The exposition was good since the protagonist is surrounded of much juvenile madness just like drink games parties red hot dialogues helping to do a pleasant road throughout all the movie,7
22 May 2020,Blogging never ends,Blogging is very inspired to mark Zuckerberg after blogging coading ultimate cool ideas will come this ideas changed range from univ to number of schools cities countries Facebook continents coading is going on awesome,7
9 November 2010,Mark-ing's on the Wall,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,9
7 February 2021,A movie to hate the facebook,I hated Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg after the movie This movie was about to become a documentary but it didn t The main Actors were good and these stars are for their performance and nothing else,3
21 February 2021,A captivating and thoroughly interesting movie,The Social Network might not seem like it has a very interesting premise but in the hands of David Fincher it is one of the most intriguing movies of the decade Aaron Sorkin s fast witty dialogue makes watching conversations so much fun This is a great movie,9
23 May 2021,"Dialogs, Music and Fish",No more words Almost everything in this masterpierce give exactly what you want Dialogs are like machine gun Jesse Eisenberg is amazing But still the most impressive part of it OST Dark slow and tense,9
25 May 2021,"Wow, that was good.",This is probably the best adapted screenplay i have ever seen on screen The direction is fresh and unique and the acting is amazing not only from Jessie Eisenberg but from Andrew and Justin This movie is perfect the score is highly addictive and everything that surrounds the craft of the film is top notch I watched this film twice just in one week Damn this is a solid movie,10
15 August 2021,Masterpiece,The first thing to say is that this is not a film about Facebook yes its based around its creators Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin but what it really is about is how their invention came between their friendship The way the film is set up works really well as far as story telling goes Mark Zuckerberg played by the brilliant Jesse Eisenberg is involved in 2 cases at once one involving co creator Eduardo Saverin played by Andrew Garfield and the other case involves Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss who claim they asked Zuckerberg to design a social networking site for Harvard and claim that Zuckerberg took their idea Eduard Saverin is also involved in that case,9
26 August 2021,The film is great,The first time I saw The Social Network 10 years ago It was great After that I saw the film several times again And it was great every time It s directed by Davis Fincher and screenplay by Aaron Sorkin It s brilliant story of what happened in 200x with the Internet and people The film isn t about facts it s about the era I hope you will like it,9
2 November 2021,Really great biography movie,Really great biography movie from tech industry I was enjoying watching it as i see how the business need to be done and how brutal it is Real face on one of our biggest website in world,9
2 June 2020,I must of missed something,I was really rather bored tbh and turned it off after an hour but after reading other reviews I tried again with it but still couldn t wait for it to finish,4
21 October 2021,This movie is an absolute masterpiece!!,A bit difficult to follow for smaller audiences but after a while it gets easier to follow In general ABSOLUTELY AMAZING also makes you understand the real Facebook story and how it started how it ended and how it became from nothing to what Facebook is now Also includes some really good actors So I really recommend everyone to watch it,9
17 November 2010,The Polishing of the Talent,Do you think that Social Network main character Mark Zukerberg is a real asshole To call the person who created the greatest fun ever an asshole would mean that all its users are literally f d up Basically in the cinematic reality created by David Fincher we could find the number of eternal messages which are wrapped in a beautifully shot movie Social Network makes us laugh hate and disguise But over all we receive the old messages about what stay behind the greatest inventions Fincher doesn t stop to look back when 10 years ago he acclaimed his greatest success Nevertheless no one would punch someone on face these days it is easier to write an asshole on a Wall to relieve anger The story line is based on the origins of the creation the Social Network called Facebook Young Mark Zukerberg pushed the idea of his fellow students so far that it turns into the billions dollars worse on line project The web site which managed to gather more than 100 million users and not going to stop its extension Coming up from the film title Social Network it doesn t tell us about Facebook no it s about what stays behind every great achievement Without reliving the details of the plot we come through the certain judgment of what the main Character Mark Zukerberg did Was it right or wrong Is he a real jerk or he d done what has to be done For somehow Fincher is afraid to ask what is Facebook In a certain way he laughs from the blondes who get hysterical about the relationship status of their boyfriends Nevertheless he s not pointing finger that such a great thing Facebook a magical feature is mostly pointless in the hands of its users and they are just a bunch of the space monkeys who don t know what to do with themselves The great things are always based on ugly and miserable thoughts like selfish revenge or youngster s teenage jealousy We are all the sources of our own miseries However unconsciously during watching the Social Network I want to come back to the Fight Club Project Mayhem was created to free the human beings But it is unreal and can survive only on the screen Facebook is real but does it have any purpose Yes in real life we can acclaim how it connected us make closer to each other However excuse me we ve got internet for this There was no conflict between Mark and his Creation Fight Club leads us to the X point of the screen reality Tyler was doing his thing considering it was totally crazy to change the reality Mark even doesn t care much about his creation he s proud of it but in the end of the day it leads him to another point of emptiness Mark and his Social Network the relationship which was missed by Fincher Facebook is acclaimed as a tool just a cool thing like a party an awesome one the party which will never end Fight Club was the reflection of ugly truth a disease which is spread in a human society But its fictional Facebook is real David Fincher polished and improved his director s skills during the decade the tension which movie brings is tremendous The disappointment comes when it gets clear that we have seen it before 10 years ago when it was wrapped in a broken collarbones and pints of blood Today it is modest nice and clean wrapped in blue paper with a white ribbon Thumbs up when comments are not necessary,7
19 March 2022,The Social Network is Amazing,This Movie is one of my all time favourite movies it show the personality of Mark Zuckerberg is shown perfectly The performance by Jessie Eisenberg is Great but the stand out here for me is from Andrew Garfield in the role that Kick Started his Career as an amazing actor and possibly my favourite actor of all time,10
22 March 2023,Wow! One of these films that really makes you think about its story.,To be fair when I first discovered The social Network and saw its success regarding prices and reviews from both fans and critics I only thought to myself Why Why make a movie about the platform that owns the communication Channels of half of world s population and only focus on its origin But after I got several recommendations from Colleagues and Friends on Campus I got curios How can a movie about the origin of Facebook impress so many people around me So I gave it a shot And boy was I wrong This Movie is a masterpiece From the deep yet disturbing soundtrack to the brilliant cinematography and creativity of each shot to the fearsome Acting of Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg and especially Andrew Garfield as his Roommate and Friend Eduardo Severin I am no professional film critic but I know that when a movie catches me and makes me think about it days and even weeks after I saw it there must be something special about it David Fyncher knows how to set up a Drama and here this experience really shines The story starts with Zuckerberg creating Facesmash a website to rate female Students on Harvard Campus after he got rejected by his Date which becomes so popular among students that the whole Campus Network crashes the same night From there on Zuckerberg is possessed by his idea to take the whole social experience in college online which ultimately leads him to conflicts with his Friend and Roommate Eduardo Severin and the Winklevoss Brothers who had a similar Idea and accuse him of stealing their Business Idea During the whole film you can really see how the Facebook that was created by a Computer Nerd and his Roommate at University slowly takes its way to become the multibillion dollar company we know today And this way is not only marked by the genius of Zuckerberg and his vision to make Facebook a global phenomenon but also by the loss of friendship greed egoism and treason A tragic combination that slowly unveils the true price of success All while the story is embedded in the two litigations between Zuckerberg and Severin on the one hand and Zuckerberg and the Winklevoss Brothers on the other When the credits finally rolled I sat there thinking about what I just saw Even after nearly a week I find myself thinking about Zuckerberg s story about his impact on modern society and communication and also about the fact that a young 19 year old Harvard Student could create and realize a vision of the future many older experienced people could not see nor build Would the world be a worse place if Facebook was never invented Did Zuckerberg really revolutionize the way we communicate Or did his actions and the rise of Facebook create something we would have never thought of if he had not been the one to realize his own vision We will never know But we certainly know that Facebook shaped modern society in the last 20 Years like no other company has and may also shape our future whether by itself or by the competition its own success has created The Social Network is a well written thought provoking drama that delivers on all fronts and in my opinion truly earns it s praise by fans critics If you decide to watch The social Network make sure to watch the official trailer first The trailer for this movie is already a masterpiece itself and catches the tone of the story to near perfection,9
13 June 2023,Insightful,If you have ever been curious of the back story of Facebook or it s creator Mark Zuckerberg then this film is for you It shows insights on how the website was created and the legalities Zuckerberg went through to proclaim his ownership Although the movie is interesting it is not a film that I would recommend freely I would recommend to those who show interest or curiosity This film is for those interested in the origin story of one of the largest and fastest growing social media networks Prior to watching this film I would have never guessed the legal or business aspects of a website and am happy to see that side of it,8
19 June 2023,Must watch!!,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,10
17 August 2023,https://tectrain.ch/de/isaqb/foundation-cpsa-f,The movie was really good I am currently taking trainings to learn software I watched it because it might interest me and I found the movie successful If you want to get training Tectrain is the place where I train The movie seems to include some exaggerations reflecting the facts a bit Frankly not every person comes across such coincidences and things do not progress so fortunately I hope there will be more movies like this Usually these strange stories of such powerful actors always fascinate me and make me wonder why Bill Gates also has parallel legends Of course a little more excitement could have been added in order to prevent stagnation,10
1 October 2023,Amazing actors and acting,I watched The Social Network because Armie Hammer was in it didn t like FB from the start still don t so may have never got to appreciate this truly excellent film Now it s among my favourites Marvelous Cast Direction and acting Amazing effects when needed them Particularly loved Jesse Eisenberg s opening scene w Rooney Mara They are so good Must have been exhausting for both He plays the ODriven original person marvelously The three main actors Jesse Eisenberg Mark Zuckerberg Andrew Garfield Eduardo Saverin and Justin Timberlake Sean Parker are excellent in their roles Jesse Eisenberg s nomination for the Oscar was truly deserved as well as the awards and nominations received not only by him but the rest of the cast The whole cast is outstanding Not forgetting Armie Hammer Cameron Winklevoss as well as Josh Pence Tyler Winklevoss,10
4 December 2010,Great from start to finish,Sorkin grabs hold with the opening scene Eisenberg s first lines of dialogue portray a dark uncaring almost sociopathic genius His lack of caring for wealth or almost anything makes for a very interesting and gripping character The directing is top notch but what else can anyone expect from David Fincher After directing movie greats such as Brad Pitt Edward Nortin and Morgan Freeman in Fight Club and Seven it s a different feel seeing him working with a more upcoming and soon to be superstar of Hollywood in Eisenberg Lets not forget about Justin Timberlake who is a perfect Sean Parker smart charismatic and even a little paranoid All in all this movie achieves levels of success in every category directing writing and acting Defiantly a must see for anyone who appreciates quality in the film industry,9
26 April 2011,A movie that changed my life,I just want to say that this is the movie that made me deactivate my facebook profile and by that change my life to the better No more staring at the wall wondering how fantastic life everyone else is having at least thats what their facebook status is saying Now I m back to phoning friends even visiting them in real life and living life as it should be lived This movie didn t tell me to do this but the story of Mr Zuckerberg is just so sad That the man who made facebook seemingly have almost no friends just about says it all See the the film use your head and make up your own mind Is facebook really that great Fincher has made a great film Eisenberg is great in the lead and even young Timberlake handles himself well 9 of 10 stars,9
7 October 2010,Facebook or something?,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,9
10 October 2010,Better than expected,I knew the basic story of Facebook a young Harvard student knew how to turn computers into addictive communication devices that ask and answer any personal question But since when were kids capable of building an empire by sucking the livelihood out of their peers The film reveals a cast of dynamic characters wanting to come out on top whose determination although resembling monsters makes viewers wanting to see deeper into the dark closet The arguments whether all the assumptions over Facebook s history ring true might never be resolved This story is a captivating performance over the possibilities over a young billionaire s achievement if not conquest,8
10 October 2010,Perfect integration of humour into an otherwise serious film.,Dramatic films are usually solely dramatic Humorous films are usually solely humorous The Social Network truly creates the best of both worlds and provides a sense of humour laced with satire irony and sarcasm from a true genius Mark Zuckerberg The lines were absolutely fantastic with every line having a deeper effect than the last Mark lives his life with a condescending manner towards anyone and everyone and prides himself on his true coding genius There are somber and stern moments as well as lighthearted and funny moments showcasing the contrasting sides of Mark s life The story of the origin of Facebook is undoubtedly quite entertaining but the overabundance of characters sometimes becomes too much Furthermore there is a slight divide between the characters and the audience because they are portrayed at an almost superficial intellectual level far superior to most audience members hence making it hard for the audience to connect Nonetheless The Social Network was an overall enjoyable film and gave me some nice Friday night entertainment,8
17 October 2010,The Social Network,One of the most prominent criticisms of The Social Network is that it is a complete dramatization and isn t even close to what happened in real life The reason for this is that what happened in real life was completely boring Mark Zuckerburg and his friends were just a bunch of computer geeks sitting around a computer in their room writing line after line of computer code If a movie accurately portrayed hacking in real life it would be one of the most boring movies ever made So of course this movie is a complete dramatization You don t go to the movies and expect it to be completely based off of fact The Social Network was a well written movie that takes the boring tale of the creation of facebook and the drama that ensued and turns it into a full blown captivating story that will keep your attention throughout the entire length of the movie It is based off of a book written by Ben Mezrich a Harvard Magna Cum Laudi graduate Which is probably the reason why it is such a thrilling script I have never read the book but the movie did a good job of following a storyline even with so much to cover The two lawsuits that the main plot of the story is based around makes a very good baseline in which everything that the movie talks about ties back to This keeps the movie on task never trekking too far off topic yet keeping the scenes flowing easily from one to the next My one complaint is that the movie was fairly over dramatic Every scene in the movie was either some really flashy over the top party scene some stupid teenage stunt scene or a scene in which people were consistently whining at each other At a certain point in the movie I just wanted everybody to get over their hormonal crying and do something Punch someone Sue them Don t just sit there and complain about it However I am probably biased on this issue as I am not a fan of useless and incompetent drama which was what this movie was all about If you are a fan of such drama then you will probably enjoy The Social Network that much more The director of this movie was David Fincher I want to briefly mention this because Fincher has directed a couple of fairly decent movies in the past such as Fight Club and Se7en He continues his trend of decent movie making in this movie However the writing and story are what make this movie Fincher only adds to the decency of the movie I am even less focused on the acting in any movie Actors are just the face of a movie they aren t what make it a good movie Anyone given enough makeup practice and enough times in front of the camera can act well It takes some amount of intelligence to write direct or even know when to invest in a good movie If you have terrible actors but good directing and writing you can end up with a well thought out movie Nonetheless if you must have my opinion on the acting of this film I guess they did a good job as well The characters did seem to line up well with their actors There is one very important topic I do want to discuss While watching this movie I started to realize that it was created in such a way that it was impartial towards the characters There were no blatant bad or good guys It was just people doing what they do and then suffering the consequences of their actions Is this a good thing Should media be neutral Well may be It depends on what the type of media is trying to do Arguing a strict point can hinder intellectual pondering of the moral If a movie portrays that this man is good and that man is bad then you aren t going to think about why what this man is good or why that man is bad because it s fairly obvious You might question the legitimacy of the movie s claim but if you re going to do that then you probably already do that with most media or at least the media that doesn t measure up to your personal political or moral beliefs Most people will just watch and accept So this is the way people use if the creator is trying to impose a strict moral through their medium However this can also alienate certain populations from enjoying certain movies It is hard to like a movie when you don t agree with what it is trying to tell you Machete would have been an awesome note that I said awesome not good movie if it wasn t so politically involved On the other hand if a movie is neutral then it can be hard to portray any sort of meaning Although I don t find this to be an entirely bad thing Like ancient Grecian or Shakespearian tragic plays a person has to think about why Creon ended his life with nothing or why Macbeth had it all and then lost it I like to sit down to a movie and then leave thinking about what I just watched and why it ended the way it did not just blindly accept that this person was right and that person was wrong Well back to the movie Should you go and see The Social Network I say yes It might not be the best movie of the year but it was a well written well developed movie Even if you hate drama don t have a facebook or even know who Sean Parker is you should still see this movie,
26 March 2014,Deserving of every accolade,In 1987 Oliver Stone produced a film that encapsulated a whole era and captured the Zeitgeist perfectly the character of Gordon Gekko crystallising the most prevalent of the seven deadly sins of the time In 2010 Stone is set on repeating this trick by attempting to pull off one of the hardest tasks in the film industry the sequel that matches up to its predecessor The timing seems perfect with the current financial crisis reflecting the true bust of the late eighties boom and the impending release of the original film s central character in real time However his film has been eclipsed by The Social Network As the seventies had All The President s Men the eighties had Stone s aforementioned Wall Street the nineties had The Insider and now after a decade without a major time capsule of a film the new millennium has The Social Network With The Social Network slamming Wall Street 2 at the box office it seems that while Stone has been missing the mark with presidential bio pics and fumbling around South America stroking the egos of Bolivarian political leaders his position that he earned cutting his teeth or should that be grinding his teeth working on Scarface as the major socio political commentator director has been usurped by a younger model in the form of David Fincher Presenting the skills he has crafted and honed since his 1995 breakthrough picture Se7en Fincher is backed by a killer script from The West Wing s Aaron Sorkin It is testament to Sorkin s ability that he managed to pull it off The facebook story is RAM full of absolutely un writable characters After all if you were to conjure a pair of opponents for Zuckerberg upon the battlefield of intellectual property would you have chosen identical twin Olympic rowers christened with the inimitable moniker of Winklevoss I wouldn t imagine so But it is in characters such as these that some of the wittiest of dialogue comes as one of the twins negates the need to hire someone for the job of intimidating facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg I m 6 4 weigh 220 pounds and there s two of me Fincher has also assembled a great cast A handful of the best young actors in America appear in this movie Jesse Eisenberg s portrayal of the character is so deft and on point that we are treated to a mesmerising display that excels past even the usual high standard of performance Fincher manages to extract from his casts He is ever unlikable ever untrustworthy and ever petty but does manage a small amount of sympathy in being that guy we all know one that brilliant borderline genius without a clue If Zuckerberg is truly anything like Eisenberg s version then an argument for Asperger syndrome stands on firm footing Andrew Garfield continues to impress slightly twisting and improving his character and performance adeptly from the film Lions For Lambs earlier in the decade playing original facebook CFO Eduardo Saverin I doubt however that the script or demand on his acting ability will match up to this role in the upcoming Spiderman movies Despite these two lead characters portrayed so excellently it is Justin Timberlake who shines as Napster founder Sean Parker In a pivotal scene Parker sums up the ideology of today s intelligent and irreverent youth echoing Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko giving the greed is good speech in 1987 verbally wrapping up the 80s yuppie mentality I can smell the outside bet for Best Supporting Actor at next year s Oscars now And I m sure this will pick up a whole load of nominations elsewhere and maybe some statuettes Lord knows it deserves every accolade it receives 2010,10
3 November 2010,A great watch,Let me tell u that this movie really connects with u if u are a facebook user That s the selling point of the movie since facebook has more than 15 million users around the world So if u are a facebook user then u will surely be excited to know how it all started And let me say the movie sticks with u right from the first minute and you will enjoy it Good performances by lead actors and a great script makes this movie a must watch for everyone I appreciate the director for getting the best out of every actor and giving us a superb movie No need to write the description about the movie go watch it yourself,10
17 November 2010,"""Bad artists copy, good artists steal""",People say they were skeptical because of the subject matter You should be intrigued by it Facebook its self is an extraordinarily indicative and important facet of modern technologically driven life This film was extraordinary in its delivery The quality and significance of dialog reminded me of 12 Angry Men Sidney Lumet One of the core themes which can also be re interpreted as It isn t where you take it from its where you take it to combined with the factor of how influential the internet and social networking are today make this film outstanding Trent Reznor Nine Inch Nails did a fantastic job with the score although it is not incredibly prominent The acting was seamless for me,10
2 November 2011,"Different movie, which I honestly think is overrated, but still good.",My first thought wow David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin this must be an awesome movie It turned out to be alright just an ordinary picture based on a true story I actually watched The Social Network just 5 minutes ago because I read it won a golden globe for best picture Drama To bad The King s Speech didn t win that would have been more fair to be honest But Besides all that the movie still fills you in and gives you perspective of what is most important in our lives which turns out to be our nearest and dearest not fame nor money What I believe works as an argument for the awards The Social Network got is It s relevant it s fresh everyone can relate to Facebook because we all use Facebook Due to the fact that all that is true I still cant see the genius in The Social Network which it got its awards from I can leave you with this The movie is very much worth watching and is also quite interesting So if you haven t seen it go rent it and think of it as a film which haven t won any awards I sure it will make it better,5
9 December 2010,The World At His Fingertips,Mark Zuckerberg And His Lessons For Entrepreneurs Mark Zuckerberg is a genius who used the power of his mind to see the invisible needs of visible human beings Something that management guru C K Prahlad called as Strategic Intent many decades back Mark also saw what he had in him and how to use it what he didn t have and where or who to get it from Mark Zuckerberg is also a shark who used the power of his mind to bite the lesser species Homo Sapiens v1 0 Homo Sapiens v1 9 in every weak spot at every opportunity For example in a court scene when the jury begs for attention Mark says his mind is on something so different that his opponents don t even have the intellectual ability to think of but will claim to be theirs But the script would have demanded that As to how Mark says the many things he says one should only see the movie to experience it Standing tall and heard the loudest was his line If you were the inventors of Facebook you would have invented Facebook All other actors are better than the best I have seen in my life but nowhere near Mark In the way I experienced it the movie is a lesson on how entrepreneurs can sow a seed called idea see them germinate to become a plant and how the plant needs to be watered so that the buds can blossom And all this has to happen at the speed of light It also highlights the importance of acknowledging the role of mentors and having the right mentors to make the unimaginable become real Is There Anything Immoral Or Unethical About Mark Businesses thrive and flourish on the greed of its founders However this greed should be directed at the competition and not on the Co Founders in letter and spirit A fact acknowledged by the court when Eduardo won his case With the money he now has he can buy the world but if ever he goes bankrupt in his lifetime again he can never get the spirit of Eduardo Saverin to be with him At no stage of the movie does the viewer get an impression that Mark Zuckerberg is An Accidental Billionaire It this technology age it always looked like a windfall that was waiting to happen Somewhere along the way if the Mark Zuckerbergs can be a bit more fair moral and ethical to the Eduardo Saverins of the world who as buddies extend every possible help in the embryonic stages of the business on money matters and not short change them the world will be a better place for entrepreneurs and the people whose families depend on them for livelihood Otherwise the Zuckerbergs suck and no wonder Mark is a Harvard drop out because there was one thing Harvard would have tried to teach him ethical and moral obligations and he would never learn,9
1 February 2011,Does one compromise loyalty to friendship and moral honesty for the end result of extreme gargantuan success? In this case yes....,I d put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time suspecting it to be a dry and slow moving film After all it was about the guy who founded Facebook so how much fun could it be I didn t much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers so I was in no hurry to see it Now I ve watched it and things have changed Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher s best films and that s from a director whose filmography is littered with gems This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success defeat lies and deceit and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world s most popular websites It s bam bam bam with barely time to breathe let alone get bored Good performances are given across the board particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield two actors I m normally disposed to dislike both of whom are excellent Technical values are unsurprisingly absolutely spectacular and it s clear that Fincher is in his element making a mini masterpiece out of the premise Splendid stuff,6

25 March 2011,"good idea, but just didn't work.",The Social Network was a good movie idea as it had drama romance etc but the story just didn t come together very well It was hard to follow and Jesse Eisenberg speaks really fast on voice overs and just in general and i didn t really know the plot much beforehand so this movie totally confused me I don t think that the problem was the actors just that the story could have been portrayed in a simpler and easier to follow way I did understand it till about and hour in then it just lost me i expected like i would any film to be able to sit back and not have to work too hard on following the plot line but this was quite complicated to follow which make it almost feel like a hassle to watch i hope this was of some use to whoever is reading this and in my opinion i probably wouldn t watch it again,4

25 May 2011,"Worth watching, even if a touch longer than necessary",How far can one girl drive a guy to go That question is at the core of The Social Network The movie follows Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg through all of the twists and turns of developing his now famous Facebook web site The social scene of America s elite universities portrayed as elitist filled with peer pressure and driven towards getting what you want provides the backdrop for the legal battles between both Mark and his friend Eduardo as well as a group of students from one of the most prestigious clubs on campus The money involved however is always secondary to the more important issues of status and social standing and the contrast of that pressure with developing actual friendships It is also of course about that one girl Erica a BU student who we first meet in a bar with Mark whose occasional appearances remind us of what gets Mark started in the first place The movie s story is definitely compelling giving us flashback insights into the process by which Facebook became a social phenomenon Though most of us know how successful the site ends up being I even got into this site through Facebook we are still left intrigued by the complicated process which drives the site forward from its humble beginnings in a Harvard dorm room The college social scene that is at the heart of the movie is also skillfully articulated with Trent Reznor s musical influence providing a tremendous soundtrack that highlights its darker undertones The film also raises a number of great questions about what it means to be social in the 21st century how are our relationships shaped by technology and in reverse how has technology developed in response to the way our relationships have already changed How we can develop a whole social network and lose all our real friends in the process creates the powerful but disturbing narrative behind this film There are a few weaknesses in the movie The story does not seem to fill the entire 120 minutes with lulls where the plot is moving a bit slowly and the characters do not provide enough of an emotional connection to keep things interesting Cutting 15 20 minutes and or further developing some of the secondary characters may have helped the story feel more consistently strong The rest of the movie s strengths however more than make up for these weaknesses and make this film well worth watching and then perhaps posting a note about on Facebook,7

22 September 2011,Great movie,The AMC theater in Times Square offered the perfect atmosphere to watch Jesse Eisenberg and Justin Timberlake star in The Social Network a drama about the popular networking site Facebook He s wired in is a common line quoted by characters in the fictional film The Social Network directed by David Fincher After viewing this movie opening weekend I realized the term wired in is the perfect way to describe how captivated I was by the film The Social Network created in 2010 follows the formation of Facebook by its founder Mark Zuckerberg The film creatively flashes back between the time line of its deceptive creation and simultaneous lawsuits against Zuckerberg by his former best friend Eduardo Saverin and three classmates The plot follows Zuckerberg and Saverin as they spontaneously create the Facebook site while studying at Harvard University Convinced the idea for Facebook was originally theirs twins Caermon and Tyler WInklevoss sue Zuckerberg for the rights to the site As the plot evolves Napster co founder Sean Parker enters the scene and corrupts the mind of Zuckerberg eventually leading to his betrayal of Saverin Viewing the film at AMC in Times Square definitely made the experience very different than it would have been if I watched the film alone It was unique to learn about Facebook in a theater with my two friends but also with a handful of strangers I remember thinking how awesome it was that almost everyone watching the movie with me also had their very own Facebook account The intense focus from the audience was evident as no one spoke or made comments throughout the entire film As far as the atmosphere AMC theater is a very familiar and comfortable theater for me The ticket price was more expensive at 13 yet these are not surprising for New York City prices Despite it being opening weekend I was surprised at how quickly lines moved and how friendly the employees were Once inside the theater my seat was comfortable and I anxiously awaited the start of the film Before the film began I was happy to discover there were not any commercials and instead there was the perfect amount of trailers As trailers are my favorite part of a movie experience my friends and I loved critiquing the future films together Though some may argue the movie is not a clear indication of the history of Facebook I think Fincher did an amazing job of translating the story with an air of suspense I thought the characters casted portrayed the types of personalities respectively and believably Timberlake for instance did a fantastic job of straying away from the typical romantic comedy character he usually plays Instead he managed to pull off the deceptive pretty boy personality of Parker convincingly and successfully The script was well written and filled with intelligent lines that sold the seriousness of the story to the viewers With the two lawsuits intertwined with the past narrative the clever combination of scenes definitely kept me as a viewer on the edge of my seat,
11 November 2011,"This movie was an OK, but dry documentary",Well acted for the most part It Seems to be a quite factual and yet a completely middle of the road true story I find that there is very little that is remarkable about the people who created Facebook But then Facebook itself is not necessarily remarkable given that all the programming architecture contained within it already existed at least 5 years before it s time the difference being not all elements were combined into one complete suite I found The Pirates of Silicon Valley to be a much more compelling if a somewhat more sensationalized version on other programmers lives and success stories Both movies end with a somewhat bittersweet end and perhaps teach us that money and success is truly not the only ingredients towards leading a happy life This movie is worth watching if you have a desire to learn more about the software industry in North America,

12 December 2011,Social Network,The Social Network 2010 is a film based off of the story of how the social networking site Facebook was created The film stars Jesse Eisenburg as founder Mark Zuckerberg Andrew Garfield as co founder Eduardo Saverin and Justin Timberlake as Napster founder Sean Parker The movie depicts the development of the social networking site as well as the obstacles Mark faces with lawsuits dealing with him stealing the idea of Facebook and diluting Eduardo s shares once the company grew The theme of The Social Network deals with inspiration betrayal and the cost of success Mark is inspired by his own idea of Facemash which was a website used to rate female students on attractiveness After being invited by Camerson and Tyler Winklevoss to be a part of the creation of their social site called The Harvord Connection Mark decided to expand his idea of Facemash into Facebook Mark and co founder Eduardo work to get Facebook launched and running and expand to other schools very quickly I believe the instant success was too much for Mark to handle as he proves in the movie he is easily influenced by Sean Parker This causes Mark to betray Eduardo when he is convinced to reduce Eduardo s shares of the company to nearly nothing The lighting throughout the film is very low key I believe this gave the feeling of realness as well as seriousness While Mark is hard at work creating the website in his apartment the lights are low which also shows him concentrating The cuts that transitioned from the story of the creation of Facebook to the current day lawsuit hearings was done very clearly and smoothly The film as well as the cuts were easy to follow and very well written The actors did a great job of portraying the actual people and made the viewer believe Although the film has been criticized for not being completely accurate the directors and writers did a great job of keeping a neutral point of view throughout as well as illustrating many different points of view including Mark Eduardo and the Winklevoss twins I very much enjoyed the film just as I suspected I would I found it to be very interesting and as a Facebook user myself it made the meaning of it even more personal,9

24 April 2012,A story of friendship and betrayal,The social network is a drama directed by David Fincher and written by Aaron Sorkin The movie follows the journey of a 19 year old computer major of Harvard Mark Zukerberg who is played by Jesse Eisenberg The movie begins with an unpleasant date in a dark lit bar with his girlfriend now ex Erica Albright played by Rooney Mara The dark atmosphere helps to set the mood of the friendly conversation that will soon become unpleasant This scene depicts an argument over Marks attempt to get into a Final Club which Erica doesn t understand The over the shoulder angles quickly switch back and forth keeping the viewer into the in depth conversation As the conversation becomes more intense the cameras become closer and closer to the actors faces putting you into their seat almost This scene sets the whole movie into motion Filled with frustration and slightly intoxicated Mark lashes out at the women at Harvard by creating a small website to rate the look of women side by side The new websites impressive growth and popularity over a span of hours draws attention to him by the Winklevoss twins both played by Armie Hammer The Winklevoss brothers present an idea for a Social Network site to Mark who quickly decides to help The movie then begins to focus its theme on the value of friendships With the new project underway Mark dodges calls and emails from the twins while he works on his own social site that is greatly parallel to that of the twin s idea Marks friend Eduardo Saverin played by Andrew Garfield helps fund his website called Thefacebook which was exclusive to only Harvard students As time passes the popularity of Thefacebook greatly increases both causing legal issues with the twins for theft of intellectual property and gains attention from Napster founder Sean Parker played by Justin Timberlake Sean decides it is time to expand the Thefacebook which is later renamed Facebook and he puts his best foot forward to help expand the website while taking his fair chunk of profits From here on in you see many conflicts of friendships and betrayal between many of the characters mostly by intercut scenes of Mark in a room full of lawyers trying to settle with both Eduardo and the Winklevoss twins I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys an in depth pop culture movie The creativity behind it is pure genius and is a must see not just once but multiple time,8
10 May 2021,One of the best movies I've ever seen!,There s too many things to list as to why this movie flows so so well Although I believe it has a lot to do with Mr Fincher,10
16 September 2012,The Social Network Review,The Director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin rush through a series of attempts and failures achievements and disloyalty ending with what feels like a gloominess conclusion on an lonely soul This film is extremely entertaining and feels like a psychologically roller coaster The film is created around a depressed inconsistency in 2003 Mark Zuckerberg played by Jesse Eisenberg is a 19 year old sophomore at Harvard Mark formulates Facebook and ultimately creates a 500 million person network of friends but he is so narcissistic driven and introverted that he can t stay close to anyone Mark dumps his one and only real friend Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield who is also a student at Harvard and assisted in helping Mark initiate the social network The film The Social Network contains amazing satire because the inner theme is not connectivity but rather a disconnection This movie is about the beginning of a technology calculated to get people closer together and showcases a main character who learns the agonizing disbanding of social connections The theme has a strong connection with the movie You ve Got Mail The new technology shows how social connections can be made without really understanding the real life connections that goes along with it The Social Network contains social disbanding is weakened by its swarming network of known friendly signifiers It implies that yes was friends with these signifiers as much as we are friends with hundreds or thousands of people on Facebook As represented in the film the social site doesn t really carry people together in a significant way The film contains dissimilar lawsuit depositions as the movies framing tool it follows this intellectual but socially uncomfortable student Mark Zuckerberg as he heads down the path moving to Facebook after breaking up with by a girl he likes Rooney Mara As an Internet joke he pulls for redemption for his punishment lands him in a mess with the Harvard board members At the same time he gathers the attention from other wealth Harvard students who would otherwise keep away from him the Winklevoss twin brothers Josh Pence Armie Hammer They offer him a job to work on their social site and later claim he stole their idea Mark also gets sued by his once best and only real friend Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield Eduado was one of the original investors to start the site Mark envisioned Mark is eventually courted by Sean Parker Justin Timerlake the owner of the music site Napster Sean convinces Mark to move his site home base to Silicon Valley to allow access to wealth venture capitalists seeking outside inventors The last scene in my opinion contains the mastery of the film by never breaking the 180 degrees during the heated conversation between Mark and Erica This meeting illustrates the spectator more into the story because there is a smaller amount of a need to resituate the person within the scene The motif that all of us can relate to is that social acceptance occurs throughout the film Mark is building Facebook because he is trying to gain social acceptance The scene that highlights this the most is when Erica questions Mark s fascination with Final Clubs because of the influence they supply its members Facebook is shown as a social network but it also shows the variations from the competitive sites The film itself is more about the creation of Facebook and the history of how the company was started more than the actual social networking site itself The movie is really about human actions more than anything else How personal agendas and greed sometimes get ahead of friendship morals and teamwork,

27 October 2012,loved it!,I found this film endearing and creative I didn t want to look away Andrew Garfield s performance was exceptional i felt drawn to his character when the time came felt sympathetic and wanted to help him Andrew did an amazing job conveying each emotion perfectly Jesse Eisenberg was as well great his facial expression and literal expression really made the film shine i only have one criticism which i would have like to have followed more of the story For example what happened to the friendship of Mark and Eduardo true you can find this information online but I would have like to have seen it played out i loved the script of this movie it did each character justice and really showed there personality s The director in this film also did an exceptional job is setting the scene and allowing us to follow the story,8
23 June 2013,Yet Another Excellent Film By David Fincher,When I heard about the film The Social Network I was a bit confused I wondered how David Fincher director of films like Fight Club and Se7en was going to pull off a movie about Mark Zuckerberg and his triumph up the social hierarchy towards his fame and stardom through Facebook After I saw this film I was absolutely amazed by how the director of such gritty crime thrillers could direct an amazing biography drama of a Harvard student creating Facebook Fincher takes up and coming star Jesse Eisenberg and turned him into to an Oscar nominee for best performance by an actor in a leading role This movie offers much more than just a kid making a web page but how through the process what he must give up and what he must gain to make it work If you are looking for a great movie with an intriguing story line excellent acting and articulate dialogue then watch The Social Network,10

1 November 2016,"The Social Network (2010) is a biographical drama by American director David Fincher, starring Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake and Rooney Mara.",I could say that I am a big fan of David Fincher s work I have seen all of his best work Fight Club 1999 Se7en 1995 Gone Girl 2014 The Curious Case of Benjamin Button 2008 and Zodiac 2007 Three of them are my favorite films of all time A lot of his films have won Oscars or have been nominated for one The Social Network tells a story about Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg who creates the social media site which nowadays we know as Facebook but is later sued by two brothers who claimed he stole their idea and the co founder who was later pushed out of the business I really liked the film although I saw it the first time few years ago after it had came out I liked it because it was so inspiring that after watching it I wanted to go and do something creative on my own I liked that it was really dramatic it was a true drama the main character went thru hell but in the end almost everything was fine I like that it shows the struggles of teenagers life the difficulties in student life how hard is university and how hard you need to work to get what you want It shows what is the actual price to make a company that ears millions There s no other film like this that is why it is so special,8
2 October 2013,"Good Biography, not the best movie",It s a fantastic movie if one wants to know the story behind one of our greatest social networks right now While it actually is a good describing of the situation and especially the conflicts approaching when Facebook gets started it is not the best movie in things like stylistic devices or impressing use of camera perspective or anything else it s just a biography and that s okay If you are not that much interested in Facebook or don t want to educate yourself the movie are two wasted hours it will start to get boring and more boring though if you want to have fun or get an story filled up with action there are many better movies I give 7 10 because i liked to know more i like Rooney Mara she s a fantastic actress and i also liked Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg but wouldn t watch the movie if i wasn t interested,9

3 March 2019,My girlfriend can't stand the fact that I'm watching this movies again and again and again and ...,I don t know why but I m always watching this movie Everything is good Music actors timeline drama jokes rhythm of the scenes photography The only two reasons why I can t give 10 stars is that there s a lot of perfect movies better than this one and that the scenario probably changed the real story a lot That being said I don t even want to know the real story now If you didn t see the movie watch it,10
9 March 2014,The social network,The Social Network is a film describing the creation of Facebook This film takes place at the University of Harvard were the student Mark Zuckenberg play by Jessie Eisenberg creates Facebook just with his laptops and his impressive intellectual This movie take us back to 2003 when Mark starts to study programing at Harvard This movie helps us to understand all the secrets and problems it took to create the famous Social Network Being the best programmer of your class seems pretty cool but don t having friends is an exception maybe it s the consequence of creating face Mach or crashing the web Mark has his pros and cons characteristics but that didn t matter for the Winklevoss and their friend Divya Narrendra when they ask to Mark to create a special project of communication for Harvard Mark accepted but he knew he had the ability to do something better so Mark start to write codes for a special project he had in mind We could see that Mark wasn t alone he had his friend Eduardo that financed and sponsored his projects The big problem begin when Sean Parker was contracted by Mark and when the brother Winklevoss and their friend heard about Mark project they knew they have to do something to confront him The social network has many incredible features but out of doubt acting was the best from all Jesse Eisenberg pictured himself as Mark Zuckenberg He used to talk as a really intellectual guy making hard to gain a dispute against him He always knew what to say when to say it and how to say it He could also express the trait of leadership and how to be the alpha he didn t let anyone to intimidate him or to take an advantage from him Jesse Eisenberg did a great job as Mark Zuckenberg even with his problems of concentration and hyperactivity he knew how to control them and satisfy his viewers Andrew Garfield as Eduardo also play a great role as being the best friend of Mark Zuckenberg and he could express with great distress the courage and anger Eduardo had when Mark made a bad play with him In a movie like the Social Network a university environment is needed for a better expression that s why a good setting didn t missed As we know Mark Zuckenberg studied at Harvard University so that s why most of the movie was film at it This help to create a teenager environment were we could see a better expression of romance disputes drugs parties and among other universities things The Social Network has a lot of impressive exponents but as we know perfect movies don t exist that s why in this movie we may find some tiny defects In the movie we may find suddenly changes of scenes from the interrogation to Mark to the sequence of the creation of the social network At first this is confusing but later you recognize what this means I had like to know more about the ending relationship between Mark and Erika Albright after all what they passed thru the movie These are some of the details we could find but as I said they are just tiny defects This movie has shared to us the way of how Facebook was created Most people thought that this movie was going to be like a documentary so they obviously thought it was going to be bored All their ideas about the movie change when they felt the delicious combination of History love troubles and impressive ideas This film let us know facts we didn t know about the creation of this impressive social network If I had to rate this movie I will give to it a 9 10 and remember that if you want to know more of this impressive film you just have to Log in,9

30 October 2014,The Social Network- the best film of all time?,David Fincher has directed many thrilling and perceptive films in the past however his latest film can be seen as his best work yet Fincher doesn t just explore the obvious ideas of personal theft violation contradiction and inhuman endeavors we are taken inside the minds of Zuckerberg we are taken into this world of social manipulation and categorization and we are inadvertently left creeping behind the door yearning to identify more of what our societies future offers Facebook is used as a tool to portray mistrust connection and denial It explores this new wave of social media and technological connections however the film really highlights our generations lack of human interaction and need to live inside their social conscience unable to listen to their own,10
24 March 2018,REMARKABLE!,This is a film which simply shouldn t work but it does magnificently A story centred on a teenager who becomes the world s youngest billionaire a web site that reaches a million users in two years and a cast of real life characters with names like Zuckerberg and Winklevoss just shouldn t be possible A convoluted tale of raw conflict on the origins of a new type of web site should not lend itself to an expensive movie as opposed to a television documentary It succeeds because it is not about the technology but about creativity and conflict and about friendship and betrayal It succeeds because of a magical combination of accomplished direction scintillating dialogue and superb acting,10

4 December 2016,Great Idea poor execution,The Social Network has a great story to tell about the rise of facebook and the journey Mark Zuckerberg made to get to where he is I was very disappointed to find out that it wasn t about this it was more about the dispute between Zuckerberg and his friend Eduardo Saverin The story the movie tells about the creation of facebook is to my dismay littered with fiction It felt like the director based the character of Zuckerberg not based on the original but on a slightly different version of Zuckerberg who is a insecure and asinine genius They portray his character this way by changing a few things about the real story of Zuckerberg In reality Mark Zuckerberg is none of these things and the portrayal of him in the movie is so far off from reality it hurts Aside from this flaw the movies main focus as far as plot is not the rise of facebook and the different challenges the team face but the relationship between Mark and Eduardo In fact the movie is almost entirely about their feud This makes sense seeing as how the movie is based off the book The Accidental Billionaires The Founding of Facebook A Tale of Sex Money Genius and Betrayal A book that tells the story of how facebook was created without any help from the creator of facebook himself Mark Zuckerberg Instead the author received a lot of help from the friend of Mark s who only funded the project Eduardo It s frustrating how to think that they would make a movie after such a crappy book but there really isn t much we can do about it now In conclusion I wish this movie had never been made 0 stars,
20 November 2021,The start of it all,This beautifully tackles the rise of facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg and the mass effect it had on the world and still continues to do so Great performances directing and cinematography and music,9
