It scans a total of 3,064,958,976 bytes and emits 54,704,849 output rows. The columns scanned are 'ss_sold_date_sk', 'ss_customer_sk', 'ss_store_sk', 'ss_quantity', 'ss_sales_price', and 'ss_ext_discount_amt'.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations**:\n",
      "1. It is suggested to join the 'store_sales' table with the 'date_dim' table on 'ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk' and apply a filter for 'd_year = 2001' during the initial table scan. This would reduce the number of rows processed and avoid scanning the entire 'store_sales' table.\n",
      "2. The common table expressions (CTEs) 'sales_2001', 'monthly_spend_increase', and 'spend_increase_percentage' should be merged into a single query block using conditional aggregation and window functions. This would reduce the number of scans and intermediate result sets.\n",
      "3. The 'ss_quantity' column should be removed from the GROUP BY clause in the 'sales_2001' CTE, as it is not necessary for the final result set and may be causing unnecessary row expansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Execution Details**:\n",
      "- The execution time of the query was 33,068 milliseconds, with a compilation time of 404 milliseconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The query text is quite complex, involving multiple CTEs and window functions. The recommendations provided aim to optimize the query by reducing the amount of data scanned and processed, and by simplifying the query structure.\n"
